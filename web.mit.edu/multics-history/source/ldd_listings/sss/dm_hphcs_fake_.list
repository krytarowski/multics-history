        8*
        9*	dm_hphcs_fake_  is  a  version  of  dm_hphcs_ to avoid ring crossing
       10*     problems  in a test Data Management system (DMS); another example of this
       11*     is  dm_hcs_fake_.  Currently, there is only one entry, ips_wakeup, and it
       12*     is  a  no-op (as opposed to trying to get to pxss_ from ring 4).  We also
       13*     use the dm_hphcs_ refname in the proc stmt to emphasis this is a fake.
       14*
       15*	This  is  written in PL/I for now and will have to be transferred to
       16*     ALM if more entries are added that need a transfer vector mechanism.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
