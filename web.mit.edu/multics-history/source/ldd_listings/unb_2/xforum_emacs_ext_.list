;;; HISTORY COMMENTS:
;;;  1) change(85-01-21,Davids), approve(86-02-04,MCR7350),
;;;     audit(86-04-24,Gilcrease), install(86-04-24,MR12.0-1048):
;;;     Modified so that the table of commands uses "CTL" for the
;;;     control key instead of "C" and "ESC" for the escape key instead
;;;     of "E".  Changed the way the subject is determined for reply
;;;     mode.  It now looks for the character <ESC> which now separates
;;;     the subject from the comment.  It then deletes the <ESC>
;;;     character and takes that location as the end of the subject.
;;;     It does all this instead of just going to the end of the line
;;;     because the subject might be several lines long (i.e.  have
;;;     embedded <NL>s).
     
;;;     85-01-22 Davids: Modified xforum:finish so that it puts an ESC
;;;     character at the end of subject text.
     
;;;     85-03-04 Davids: Added the reply_by_subject mode.  This acts like
;;;     reply mode except when things are being set up in xforum:reply.
;;;     If its by_subject a string representing the transaction number is
;;;     obtained and a search is made to position the buffer to the
;;;     transaction.
;;;  2) change(85-06-25,Davids), approve(86-02-04,MCR7350),
;;;     audit(86-04-24,Gilcrease), install(86-04-24,MR12.0-1048):
;;;     Removed all references to xforum_help_line_$pop.  Replaced all
;;;     references of xforum_help_line_$push_general_message_only with
;;;     calls to xforum_help_line_$change_general_message_only.  This was
;;;     easier than trying to figure out all the places that pops would be
;;;     needed.  Without the pops you would get help_line stack overflows
;;;     after entering about 7 comments in a row.
;;;  3) change(86-02-06,LJAdams), approve(86-02-18,MCR7350),
;;;     audit(86-04-24,Gilcrease), install(86-04-24,MR12.0-1048):
;;;     Added command-quit to quit handler for reconnect.
;;;                                                      END HISTORY COMMENTS


;;; Emacs extension to implement Executive Forum functions.
;;; Deryk Barker December 1983
;;; A certain amount of "borrowing" from xmail stuff
;;; 84-04-03 Senft: changed size of mini-buffer from 5 to 3
;;; 84-06-12 Schimke: Modified for compatibility with xmail extension:
;;;          commented out many of the extended features which require the site
;;;          to have full emacs (these may be added back compatibly with xmail 
;;;          at a future date), improved quit handler to warn before destroying
;;;          unsaved text, installed improved yesp function.
;;;
;;; 84-08-01 Davids: Modified xforum:instructions for reply mode to make the
;;; instructions correspond to the xforum MTB. Also modified xforum:help so
;;; that a better prompt is issued to the user and so that the ? response
;;; gives the appropriate list of commands. This was the extended features that
;;; were commented out by Dave.
;;;
;;; 84-08-02 Davids:modified xforum:insert-file and xforum:modify-subject
;;; to call xforum_status_$push_help_line, pop_help_line, and update_help_line.
;;; This improves help message handling. Also replaced references to
;;; transaction with references to comment in the help text.
;;;
;;; 84-08-06 Davids: Modified go-to-beginning-of-buffer to check and see if
;;; the user is currently in the minibuffer and if so to just use the standard
;;; go-to-beginning-of-buffer
;;;
;;; 84-08-10 Davids: Added missing commands to the help table and created a 
;;; separate table for reply mode. Added the display-buffer-as-pintout function
;;; and deleted the loadlib of e_macops_. Loading e_macops_ was very expensive
;;; to get just one same function. Add documentation to some of the commands
;;; which were still missing it.
;;;
;;; 84-10-01 Davids: Changed calls to xforum_status_$push_help_line,
;;; pop_help_line and update_help_line to
;;; xforum_help_line$push_general_message_only, pop, and
;;; push_general_message_only.
;;;
;;; 84-10-16 Davids: Changed the help line for modifing the subject so that
;;; it has the same format as the help line when entering a new subject. That
;;; help line is displayed by xforum_attend_mtg_options.
;;;
;;; 84-11-19 Davids: Changed xforum_help_line calls to xforum_help_line_
;;; calls. 
;;;
;;; 84-11-26 Davids: Added a test to the xforum:refill function so that it
;;; calls xforum:beginning-of-paragraph only if it is not already at the
;;; the beginning of the paragraph. The beginning of paragraph function will
;;; move you to the beginning of the next paragraph if you are at the beginning
;;; of the current paragraph. 
;;;

;;; Load in the necessary include files.
(%include e-macros)  
(%include backquote)

;;; To use in debug mode, remove the semicolon at the beginning of this line:
;(sstatus feature debug)

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
