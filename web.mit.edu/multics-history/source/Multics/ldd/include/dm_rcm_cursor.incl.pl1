Written by Matthew Pierret, 04/05/82.
Modified:
08/19/82 by Matthew Pierret:  Version 2. Changed collection_id to 
            bit (36) aligned.
07/28/83 by Matthew Pierret: Changed name from dm_rm_cursor.incl.pl1 to
            dm_rcm_cursor.incl.pl1.
04/13/84 by Lee Baldwin:  Renamed pf_opening_id to file_opening_id to coincide
            with the naming conventions used in the rcm_XX routines.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group Bull including Bull HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell Bull Inc., Groupe Bull
and Bull HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture for 
managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
