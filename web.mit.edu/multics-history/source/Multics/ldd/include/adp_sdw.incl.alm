" Historical Background
"
" This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
" to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group Bull including Bull HN Information Systems Inc. 
" as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
" This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
" Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell Bull Inc., Groupe Bull
" and Bull HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
" Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
" renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
" of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture for
" managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems
" incorporated Multics principles.
" Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
" as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
