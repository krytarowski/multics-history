/* HISTORY:

Written by Matthew Pierret, 05/19/83. 
Modified:
06/24/83 by Lindsey L. Spratt:  Changed to version 2.  Added the current.flags
            structure, to add the search_index_and_record_collection flag.
            This flag is only meaningful when doing a relative search.  It is
            used by rlm_general_search to know what state the
            internal_search_specification was left in (suitable for searching
            the index or suitable for searching the records).
10/29/84 by Stanford S. Cox:  Changed to not init version.
02/12/85 by S. Cox:  Chg and_group_idx to fb17, current.flags.mbz to bit35.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group Bull including Bull HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell Bull Inc., Groupe Bull
and Bull HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture for 
managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
