     This  document  has  been  prepared  automatically  from the
system source by Multics Software Support.  Every effort has been
made  to supply  documentation for  each and  every message  that
could appear either on the system console, or in the system logs.
However,  some of the  system messages are  not provided in  this
document due  to the messages developed prior  to the development
of  the  error  messages  document,  or  omitted  in  error.  The
following is a list of modules  that are known to be missing from
this document:

     For each message,  an example of the text of  the message is
provided, followed by four  paragraphs:  Severity, Time, Meaning,
and Action.






                               -1-                       12/18/86

     The message example  is a literal copy of  the message, with
substitutable fields  shown in all capitals.   Each substitutable
field is described in the Meaning paragraph.


_O_u_t_p_u_t

     The output  field describes how the message  is output.  For
hardcore  messages  it  shows  the  interpretation  of  the first
argument to SYSERR, which  determines whether the system crashes,
sounds  the  beeper,  etc.   For  answering  service messages, it
describes the output stream and source.


_T_i_m_e

     The  time section  describes the  time when  the message  is
possible.


_M_e_a_n_i_n_g

     The meaning paragraph describes  the situation that prompted
the  message and the  probable cause of  the situation.  It  then
describes  the  consequences  of  the  situation.   Substitutable
parameters in the message example are explained here.


_A_c_t_i_o_n

     The  action  paragraph  describes  what  operator  action is
required when the message occurs.





















                               -2-                       12/18/86

     Time:     System Intialization.

     Meaning:  The  physical configuration  or the  configuration
               deck is  incorrect.  DPS8 CPUs have  only 4 memory
               ports, therefore Multics systems comprised of DPS8
               cpus or  mixed systems of  DPS, L68 and  DPS8 cpus
               can  only  have   4  memories  configured.   (i.e.
               Memory tags A, B, C, and D).

     Action:   Correct  the  physical  configuration  and/or  the
               configuration deck and reboot.

               command.

     Meaning:  Indicates  success  or  failure  of  the  command.
               ACTION can be defer or  release, and N can be "no"
               or the number of requests acted upon.

     Action:   Confirm that the expected results were obtained.



               [absentee_utility_.pl1]
               abs  run:   job   selection  arguments  matched  N
               requests; be more specific.


     Stream:   as (severity1)

     Time:     In response to an abs run command.

     Meaning:  The  specified arguments  matched either  zero, or
               more than one, request, and so no job was run.

     Action:   Re-enter  the command  with correct  arguments, to
               select exactly one job for running.

               completion.


     Stream:   as (severity1)

     Time:     When shutting down the absentee facility.

     Meaning:  This  message is  printed after  the operator  has
               issued  an  abs  stop  command  or  the system has
               issued  an automatic  abs stop  prior to shutdown.
               The  system  waits  until  all  absentee jobs have
               finished before logging them  out, then prints the
               message.

     Action:   It is now safe to proceed with the shutdown.

               if the resources it needs happen to be unavailable
               when it  requests them.  There is  some problem in
               the resource reservation mechanism.

     Action:   Contact the system programming staff.



               [absentee_user_manager_.pl1]

     Stream:   as (severity1)

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  An unrecognizable event  message has been received
               from the Answering Service.   Its value is printed
               in octal.  Usually, the first word is the function
               code  and the  second word   is the  index in  the
               absentee user  table.  This condition is  due to a
               error  in   the  Answering  Service   or  absentee
               programs.  The system ignores  the signal and goes
               on.  The absentee facility may cease to operate.

     Action:   If absentee  jobs will no  longer run, try  an abs
               stop  and   an  abs  start.   Inform   the  system
               programming staff.

     Stream:   BOS Typewriter (Crashes system)

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  In  attempting  to  create  a  process, the system
               could not  force the PDS or  descriptor segment of
               that  process  to  be  activated  and held active.
               ERRORMESSAGE  is  an  error_table_  message.  This
               indicates a logic error  in the supervisor, or CPU
               or memory hardware problems.

     Action:   Follow normal recovery procedures.

     Stream:   Logged in SYSERR log.

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  The     project    administrator     (or    system
               administrator) for  user GROUPID set  the kst_size
               parameter in  the PDT to SIZE, which  is less than
               the  valid minimum  MIN_SIZE.  The  process is not
               created.   Note that  a process  with MINIMUM  KST
               size will probably not be of any use.  The minimum
               useful KST size is on the order of MINIMUM + 50.

     Action:   Change the PMF/PDT.

               constant in the  Answering Service programs.  This
               may  be because  the  SAT  has been  destroyed, or
               because  an  incorrect  version  of  the Answering
               Service  programs  is   being  used.   This  error
               crashes the system.

     Action:   Contact the  system programming staff.   They have
               to  either  generate  a  new  SAT,  or install the
               correct version  of the Answering Service.   If no
               system programmers are available, enter admin mode

               or in STEP, or it may be in a very tight loop.

     Action:   Check the CPU panel.   If the processor appears to
               be in a  loop, it may be possible to  break it out
               by  placing zeros  in the  processor switches  and
               using  the EXECUTE  button to  cause a  fault; but
               this action sometimes causes  the system to crash,
               depending on where the loop is.

               device  which need  to be  flushed to  the pack on
               DSKX_NN  cannot be  written out.   The data remain
               where they were and ESD may be tried again.

     Action:   If the drive can be  made ready, make it ready and
               try  ESD again.  Do  NOT move packs  before trying
               ESD, unless address plugs  are changed so that the

               will volume salvage it when it is next brought up,

     Meaning:  An emergency interrupt has  been received from FNP
               X indicating it has  crashed.  All lines dialed to
               FNP X  will be hung  up.  The crash  was nominally

               interrupts


     Stream:   BOS Typewriter.

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  The FNP has masked the  channel whose name is NAME
               because it  was generating interrupts  faster than
               they could be handled.

     Action:   The interruptions  can be caused by  any number of
               problems.  This can be caused by the dataset leads
               changing too  fast for the FNP  software to handle
               properly; disconnecting or  connecting FNP cables,
               powering  off or  on a  hardwired terminal,  a bad
               modem,  etc.  It  is  also  possible that  the FNP
               channel hardware is defective.  Future attempts to
               use this  channel may possibly crash  the FNP.  CS
               representatives   may  need    to  be   called  to
               investigate.    An   "attach"   command   will  be
               necessary to put the channel back in service.

               in an  inconsistent state.  The effect  of this is
               that  some  free  records  and/or  free VTOCEs are
               unavailable   (lost)   to   the   system.    These

               salvage.  The number of  unused records and VTOCEs
               which are available for use is printed.

     Action:   If the  number of free  records or free  vtoces is
               low, a  physical volume salvage should  be done on
               the volume  prior to mounting it  again to recover
               the lost items.

     Meaning:  A recursive error condition was encountered:  that
               is, the  collection zero error handler  was called
               recursively.  The  low half of the  A contains the
               unique error  number of the recursive  error.  See
               the   listing  of  bootload_error.alm   for  error
               numbers.  bootload_error$disaster_AQ  contains the
               AQ at the time of recursive entry.

     Action:   This error  indicates a logic error  or a hardware
               problem.  Use  execute switches to return  to BOS.
               Try  a different tape.   Failing that, look  for a
               CPU problem.

     Meaning:  When wakeups are sent from one process to another,
               or from a  device like a tape drive  to a process,
               the   wakeups  are   stored  temporarily   in  the
               Interprocess Transmission Table (ITT).  If wakeups
               are  sent too  fast, or  if the  receiving process
               never calls block to read its wakeups, the ITT may
               overflow.  When  the ITT is full,  this message is
               printed  for   each  lost  wakeup.    The  message
               identifies  the sender of  the wakeup, who  may be

     Stream:   as (severity1)

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  This message  is typed out when a  user is bumped.
               A user may be bumped by another member of his load
               control  group, in  which case  REASON is  pr_grp,
               which means group preemption.  If a secondary user
               is bumped by a primary  user, either from the same
               group  or from  another group,  REASON is  pr_sec,
               meaning secondary  user preemption.  If  REASON is
               pr_emrg,  meaning emergency  preemption, a  system
               programmer  was logging  in and  had to  bump some
               user.  A user is usually given three minutes after
               this message to clean up  and log out before being
               automatically logged out.

     Action:   No operator action is required.

               bulk, shift ZZ


     Stream:   as (severity2)

     Time:     May occur at any time.

     Meaning:  The  automatic  setting  of  maxunits  by the load
               control   facility   was    attempted,   but   the
               configuration tables did  not have a configuration
               defined  that matched  the current  configuration.
               No change was made  to the system parameters.  The
               system  continues  operation,  selecting  the last
               entry   in  the    config  tables   (which  should
               correspond to the largest  system described by the
               system  administrator.)   The  values  assumed  by
               automatic  load control  are given  in the  second
               line of the message.

     Action:   Set  maxunits  and   the  absentee  max  manually.
               Inform  the system  administrator so  that he  can
               update the load control tables.

     Stream:   as (severity2)

     Time:     While  the  system  is  running  or  during system
               startup.

     Meaning:  Either  some system  table has  been damaged  or a
               system  administrator  was   changing  work  class
               definitions at the time of a shift change, or when

               immediately   preceding  this  one   contain  more
               information about the exact nature of the problem.

     Action:   Contact the system administrator.  He may want you
               to  type  the  "maxu  auto"  command  to retry the
               operation that  failed.  If that  command produces
               no   error   messages,   the   problem   has  been

     Meaning:  The   master_group_table  entry   for  GRPID   has
               vanished.  The  system is attempting to  preempt a
               user  from that  group but  cannot find  the table

     Stream:   as (severity2)

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  The system  administrator has designated  that the
               project PROJ  should be in the  load control group
               GRPID but the entry  in the master_group_table for
               that  load  control  group  is  missing.  The user
               cannot log in.  This may be an indication that the

     Meaning:  A project administrator has designated that one of
               the users  in project PROJ  should be in  the load
               control group GRPID,  but the system administrator
               has  not authorized  that  project  to be  in that
               group.  An  attempt will be  made to log  the user
               in,  using  the  default  group  for  his project.
               Subsequent messages  will indicate the  success or

     Action:   Contact the system administrator.

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  A system  or project administrator  has designated
               that  the user  NAME.PROJ  should  be in  the load
               control  group GRPID,  but the  master_group_table
               (mgt)  has no  entry for  that group.   An attempt
               will be made to log the user in, using the default

               load_ctl_:   maxu  too  small  (XX),  YY units for
               group GRPID


     Stream:   as (severity2)

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  The  system administrator  has specified  that the
               load control group GRPID is to have "all the rest"
               of the  primary load units after  all other groups
               have   taken  their  allocations   from  maxunits.
               However,  maxunits is  less  than  the sum  of the
               primary  allocations, giving  the group  GRPID the
               negative  allocation  of  YY  units.   The  system
               proceeds,  attempting to  log the  user in anyway.
               Of  course, the  user is  allowed secondary status
               only if he  is allowed to log in at  all.  This is
               often  the result of  the operator typing  maxu 30
               instead of maxu 300, or some similar error.

     Action:   Check the value of maxunits  and, if a mistake was
               made,  correct  it.   If  the  maxunits  value  is
               correct,  note  this   situation  for  the  system
               administrator.

     Meaning:  The  system administrator  has accidentally  given
               more than one group a  "take all the rest" maximum
               primary unit allocation.  The user control package
               cannot  handle this  situation.  The  second group
               with a -1 maxprim is listed.  The system completes

               to  log this  user in,   some other  user must  be
               bumped,  but  all  users  have  primary status and
               cannot  be  bumped.   This   situation  may  be  a
               consequence   of  system   programmers  with   the

     Action:   If this is a cold  boot, which is most likely, the
               RPV was initialized  without a hardcore partition.
               It  must  be  reinitialized.   Check  the  PART HC
               CONFIG  card, one of  which must describe  the RPV
               during a cold boot, and  reboot.  If this is not a
               cold  boot, the RPV  has been damaged,  and volume
               recovery must be undertaken.

     Meaning:  In  attempting  to  allocate  space  for  hardcore
               segment  SEGNAME, no more  room could be  found in
               any of the defined hardcore partitions.

     Action:   If  this is  a  cold  boot, redefine  the hardcore
               partition of the RPV to  be larger.  At least 1000
               (decimal) records is recommended.  Change the PART
               HC  CONFIG  card  describing  the  RPV to indicate
               this,  and reboot.   If this  is not  a cold boot,
               this  situation is  highly unlikely  and indicates
               damage to  one or more RLV  volume labels.  Volume
               recovery  for part  or all  of the  RLV should  be
               undertaken.

     Meaning:  A problem has been  discovered in the threading of
               the message coordinator  segment ENAME.  CALL_CODE
               identifies  the particular  call that  failed, and
               MESSAGE  identifies the   reason for  the failure.
               Entry identifies the  entrypoint in mrd_util_ that
               was  called.  All  pending messages  in ENAME  are
               discarded.  Debugging information  is written into

               with the  loss of some input or  output.  If ENAME
               is mc.message, some daemon output may be lost.  If
               ENAME is anything else,  some input to that daemon
               may be  lost, and the operator  should communicate
               with  the  daemon  immediately,  in  case this has
               happened.   This indicates  a logic  error in  the

     Time:     Reconfiguration (e.g., adding or deleting a CPU)

     Meaning:  The supervisor was unable to set the configuration
               register in  the SCU indicated after  10 attempts.
               To avoid  a system crash, the SCU  must be cleared
               manually.   In this  message, the  supervisor will
               print  a  diagram  of  the  SCU Maintenance Panel,
               indicating how each switch should be set.

     Action:   The  operator should copy  the diagram of  the SCU
               Maintenance  Panel printed  by the  supervisor (or
               take the copy printed, if possible).  The operator
               should then go to the Maintenance Panel of the SCU
               indicated  and set each  switch on the  diagram to
               the indicated position, and  then verify that each
               switch  is  in  the  correct  position.  Following
               this, the  operator should set  the Program/Manual

               database.   The system  cannot run  unless a known
               zone is specified.

     Action:   Update the CLOK card so  that it contains a proper
               zone name.  If  the zone you need is  not known to
               the  system,   time_info_.cds  will  have   to  be

     Time:     System Intialization.

     Meaning:  The cycle port priority on  the SCUs cannot be set
               optimally  because the  range of  port numbers for
               CPUs and IOMs overlap.  The manual settings of the
               cycle port  priority switches on the  SCUs will be
               used instead.  The  system may experience problems
               as  a  result,  with  the  typical  symptom  being
               op-not-complete  faults at   random times  by CPUs
               with   higher  port    numbers  (lower   SCU  port
               priority).

     Action:   Continue  to  operate  the  system  normally,  but
               consult  with  Field  Engineering  personnel.   If
               possible,  the system   should be  reconfigured so
               that the range of port  numbers of IOMs and CPU do
               not   overlap.    Further,   CPU   should   be  on
               higher-numbered ports than IOMs and Bulk Stores.

     Meaning:  There  are no more  free entries available  in the
               system  trailer  segment,  str_seg.   This  may be
               indicative of software- or hardware-induced damage

               number of logged-in processes  which is vastly too
               large.   A  more  likely  cause  is insufficiently
               large  str_seg.  The  size of  the str_seg  can be
               changed by  the TBLS STR card in  the config deck.
               This indicates a logic error in the supervisor, or
               CPU  or  memory  hardware  problems.   This  error
               crashes the system.

     Action:   Follow  normal  recovery  procedures.   It  may be

               encacheability  state  of  a  segment  had  to  be
               changed.  Such change can  only occur if processes
               are  connected to  the segment.   This indicates a
               logic  error in the  supervisor, or CPU  or memory
               hardware problems.

     Meaning:  Some disks could not be  shut down due to hardware
               problems.   Messages   have  occurred  identifying
               these drives  and the problems.  All  other drives
               have  been shut  down- their  contents are  not in
               main memory or on the  paging device.  The RPV has
               not been shut down either, so that the system will
               perform some salvaging when it comes up.

     Action:   Attempt to ready those  drives that are not ready.
               When this has been done, retry ESD.  If the drives
               have been made accessible, ESD will succeed with a
               normal  "shutdown  complete"   message.   If  they
               cannot be  made ready, the paging  device (if any)

     Stream:   BOS Typewriter (Crashes system)

     Time:     System shutdown

     Meaning:  During  an attempt  to shut  down the  system, the
               system  could not run  on the bootload  CPU.  This
               problem  may  be  due   to  hardware  or  software
               problems.  The system will attempt to crash, which
               it may not complete.

     Action:   If  the system  does not  complete its  attempt to
               crash, it  should be crashed manually.   It may be
               necessary  to change   the bootload  CPU manually.
               This  can be  done by  putting all  CPUs into STEP
               mode, manually assigning an  interrupt mask to the
               new bootload CPU from the bootload SCU maintenance
               panel,  taking only  the new  bootload CPU  out of
               STEP mode,  and doing an EXECUTE  SWITCHES on that
               CPU.  Once the system has crashed successfully, an
               ESD  should be  attempted.  This  will most likely
               succeed.

     Stream:   BOS Typewriter (Crashes system)

     Time:     System shutdown

     Meaning:  During  the attempt  to shut  down the  system, an
               unexpected condition has been signalled.  This may
               result from hardware problems, or a logic error in
               the supervisor.  The system crashes and returns to
               BCE, whereupon an ESD should be attempted in order
               to finish  flushing Multics information  from main
               memory.     Because   of    the   difference    in
               implementation between normal shutdown and ESD, it
               is possible  that ESD will not  encounter the same
               problem, and instead be successful.

               [x25_mpx.pl1]
               x25_mpx(CHN):     Link    disconnected    due   to
               mis-matched frame sizes.  CMDR/FRMR frame:  FRAME.


     Stream:   Logged in SYSERR log.

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  The  FNP has received  a command reject  (LAPB) or
               frame  reject (LAP)  which specified  a reason  of
               "wide frame"  on channel CHN.  The  actual level 2
               command is  FRAME.  This means the  frame received
               by the other end was too long.  Instead of looping
               continuously trying  to send this frame,  the link
               will be  disconnected.  The maximum frame  size in
               the  Multics TTF for  this link should  be checked
               against the size expected by  the other end of the
               link, and corrected.

     Action:   Contact the system programming staff.

               x25_mpx(CHN):  No buffers available.


     Stream:   Logged in SYSERR log.

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  x25_mpx  was unable  to  allocate  a buffer  for a
               protocol  packet.  This  indicates a  severe space
               problem  in tty_buf.   The multiplexer  will sends
               itself a "hangup" order after freeing any space it
               has  for  protocol  packets  in  tty_buf.  If this
               multiplexer is  not the cause of  the problem then
               the system is likely to crash soon.
