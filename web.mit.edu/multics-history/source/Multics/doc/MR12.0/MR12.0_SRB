                        CONTENTS OF MR12.0






_H_A_R_D_W_A_R_E _S_U_P_P_O_R_T

A- 1. This release supports the  new Information Multiplexer Unit
      (IMU) I/O  Subsystem including the controllers  and devices
      enumerated  below  on  Multics  systems  with DPS8/M CPU's.
      This release also supports systems  having a mixture of IMU
      and  IOM  I/O  subsystems.   The  IMU  is  not supported on
      systems with Level 68 or DPS68 CPU's.

A- 2. This  release supports  the new  Peripheral Processing Unit
      (PPU)  attached through  either an   IOM or  IMU.  The  PPU
      supports a  variety of configurations  of the new  low cost
      Disk Adapter Unit (DAU) and the single bucket buffered tape
      controller.

A- 3. The MSU3380 and MSU3381 FIPS  disk drives are now supported
      by the  Multics system.  For  file system IO  these devices
      are divided into subvolumes, two  for the MSU3380 and three
      for  the  MSU3381.   Each  subvolume  is  equivalent  to  a
      physical  volume.  For  user IO,  the entire  device may be
      attached as one entity.

A- 4. The  MTU8205,  MTU8206,  and  MTU8208  tape  drives are now
      supported  by  the  Multics   system.   These  devices  are
      identified on the "prph tapX" card as model 8200.

B- 1. Support for  the IBM1050, IBM2741, ARDS  terminals and Bell
      202ETX  protocol was  declared removed  in the  MR11.0 SRB.
      The 963 and 029 preaccess commands were not removed at that
      time but have been removed in this release.  The cv_ttf and
      cv_cmf commands will no longer accept these devices.

C- 1. Enhanced online Test and Diagnostics to support test of all
      devices  attached  to  an   IMU  subsystem.   This  testing
      includes peripheral  tests for all current  devices as well
      as the new FIPS disk  and tape devices.  Tolts testing will
      also include testing of the IMU channels via test pages for
      the Maintenance Channel Adaptor (MCA) of the IMU.

C- 2. Added   a   deck_file_manager    subsystem   for   improved
      maintenance  of  the  T&D  Deck  File.   This facility will
      enable  loading a  deckfile from  either tape  (IFAD or 355
      deckfile)  or  MCA  diskette.   It  will  also  provide for
      editing/patching of  octal and hex object decks  as well as
      deleting files from the deck file.

D- 1. Added  the -output_etb_mode   attach description  option to
      bisync_ to control  the use of an ETB or ETX  at the end of
      each  record.  The  attach description  will cause  a whole
      segment to  be interpreted as a  block of data.  It  may be
      required to send the block  of data out using many records.
      With this change, an ETB and  ETX will be used to terminate
      each  record  as  controlled  by  the  presence or absence,
      respectively, of this option.

D- 2. A number of  new terminal types have been added  to the TTF
      and  a number  of enhancements  have been  made to  current
      ones.

      202ETX  protocol was  declared removed  in the  MR11.0 SRB.
      The  TTF was not  updated at the  time.  The terminal  type
      entries have been removed from the TTF in this release.

D- 3. Users of IBM3270 multiplexers must use the mode "raw3270io"
      instead  of  "raw3270"  to  effect  the  full  set  of 3270
      features.

D- 4. Incompatibly changed the event message information which is
      set  by  tty  when  sending  a  wakeup  to be structured as
      described in net_event_message.incl.pl1.

D- 5. The  structure  used  by  the  undocumented  hcs_$tty_order
      subroutine     for     the     set_echo_break_table     and
      get_echo_break_table   control  requests  (as   defined  in
      mcs_echo_neg.incl.pl1)  has  been  changed  incompatibly in

F- 1. Added  the save  and restore   commands to  BCE.  They  are
      replacing the current function of the BOS commands SAVE and
      RESTOR.

F- 2. Added the copy_disk command to  bce to replace the BOS SAVE
      COPY functions.

F- 3. Modified the  BCE fwload request  to be capable  of loading
      firmware into  crossbarred DISK MPCs.   Noncrossbarred DISK
      MPCs can be loaded by using the BCE reinitialize request.

F- 4. Added  the lock_mca  and  unlock_mca  BCE commands.   It is
      recommended that Maintenance Channel Adaptors (MCAs) on all
      system IMUs  be placed on the Multidrop  interface with the
      master console configured in the Multics configuration deck
      as either  "on" or "alt".   The MCA number  assigned by the
      rocker switches  on the MCA should  be the same as  the IMU
      number  it is  in.  See  the System  Maintenance Procedures
      (SMP) manual  and the System Console  WIPC66LD Installation
      Manual, Order Number 58010084, for additional information.

H- 1. MR12.0  will  not  be  recertified.   Strict  adherence  to
      Configuration  Management procedures  developed in  concert
      with  the National  Computer Security  Center (NCSC) assure
      that MR12.0 remains as secure as MR11.0

H- 2. Added  (display set  edit)_process_audit_flags commands  to
      allow  manipulation of  the  security  auditing flags  in a
      privileged process.   Permanent setting of flags  should be
      accomplished  by placing   the appropriate  PNT/SAT entries
      with the new_user and edit_proj commands.

I- 1. Administrators  may  now  set  weekly  cutoff  periods  for
      projects or users on projects.  The keyword 'weekly' may be
      placed  in  the  PMF  for  the  project  or  user,  the PMF
      re-converted with cv_pmf, and the new PDT installed.  Sites
      which  have  specially  modified  software  for  accounting
      should  examine  how  weekly   cutoffs  will  affect  their
      modifications.  The modified  modules are cv_pmf, act_ctl_,
      adjust_cutoff_, print_pdt, and proj_usage_report.


_A_n_s_w_e_r_i_n_g _S_e_r_v_i_c_e

J- 1. Added  the  -process_id,  -pid,  control  argument  to  the
      operator  who, and  privileged as_who,  command.  When this
      control  argument  is  specified,  the  process_ids will be
      displayed  along   with  any  other   information  normally
      returned.   Added the  -connected control  argument to list

K- 1. Deleted  the  undocumented   library  maintenance  commands
      object_submission_test,             source_submission_test,
      acceptance_test, and abs_control.

K- 2. Added   the   -io_command,   -ioc,   control   argument  to
      io_error_summary to display the  I/O command being executed
      when  an  abnormal  status  occurs.   The  command  will be
      displayed   in  octal,   in  parenthesis,   prior  to   the
      interpreted status.

K- 3. Added  the  -fill  and  -no_fill  control  arguments to the
      update_seg  initiate operation  to control  filling of  the
      -log operation.

K- 4. Added -desc  as the short name for  the -descriptor control
      argument      accepted     by      the     library_cleanup,
      library_descriptor,       library_fetch,      library_info,
      library_map, library_pathname, and library_print commands.

      Added -comp  as the short name for  the -components control
      argument  accepted  by   the  library_fetch,  library_info,
      library_map, and library_print commands.

      Added  short  names  of   -bc  for  -bit_count,  -cont  for
      -container,  -iacl for  -initial_acl, -lev  for -level, -ml
      for -max_length, and -uid  for -unique_id control arguments
      accepted    by   the    library_info,   library_map,    and

L- 1. Modified the bound_dumper_ subroutine, hierarchy dumper, to
      allow the operator  to retype a mistyped tape  label, or to
      enter quit  in response to  the tape label  query to signal
      the intent that the current  invocation of the dumper is to
      be  abandoned.  Also,  modified bound_dumper_  to abort the
      invocation  of the  dumper  in  case of  unrecoverable tape
      errors, tape  mount denials, or if the  operator gives quit
      as a tape label.

M- 1. Changed the  binder to only resolve  links internally based
      on the  names of the  components and any  synonyms given in
      the bindfile.

M- 2. Modified ALM to support double word constants for octal and
      decimal numbers.   The 'even' pseudo-op should  precede the
      use of  the 'oct' or  'dec' pseudo-op when  defining double
      word  constants to  ensure that  labels will  refer to  the
      appropriate  location.   Double   word  constants  will  be
      identified  by  having  a  trailing  capital  L.   Example:
      '1234567891234L'.

M- 3. Added  the  ext_entry  pseudo-operation  to  ALM to provide
      support  for the Multics  C Compiler and  Runtime Facility.
      Added the dec_unal and oct_unal pseudo-operations to define
      unaligned constants.

M- 4. Modified  the oct  and dec  psuedo-operations to  no longer
      automatically  align double   precision contants  on double
      word boundaries.

_C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s

N- 1. Modified   the   set_fortran_common,   date_compiled,   and
      print_link_info  commands  to  support  object multisegment
      files.

N- 2. Modified the  salvage_dir command to no  longer require the
      message_path  argument.  If  not supplied,  output will  be
      displayed on the terminal.

N- 3. Modified the validate_info_seg command  to no longer accept
      the -output_file  (-of), -brief (-bf), -long  (-lg), -force
      (-fc), -no_force  (-nfc), -fill (-fi), and  -no_fill (-nfi)
      control  arguments.  Added  the -names  (-nm) and -no_names
      (-nnm)  control arguments to  determine whether or  not vis
      will  change the  names on  the info  segment to  match the
      names used in the info segment.

N- 4. Extended the  do command to allow  use of &0, &r0,  &q0, or
      &control_string   (equivalent  to    &q0)  to   insert  the
      unexpanded controls string into the result string.  Because
      the  meaning of  &r&n and   &q&n become  ambiguous when  no
      arguments  are given  (when &n   = 0),  the do  command was
      incompatibly  changed to  make  those  forms an  error; use
      &rf&n and &qf&n instead.

      The behavior  of requoting constructs like  &r1 was changed
      so  that  when  such  constructs  are  consecutive  with no
      intervening space no spurious quotes are created.

      Added the -abort_line  and -no_abort_line control arguments
      to affect  subsystem behavior.  The default  is -abort_line
      so   that  the   standard  behavior   is  unchanged.   With
      -abort_line,  an error  in a  request line  invoked by "do"
      will abort  not only the  request line invoked  by "do" but
      also the request line  invoking the "do" command.  Extended
      the "do" command to allow  control arguments to precede the
      control string.   The control arguments apply  only to that
      invocation of the "do" command.
















Contents of MR12.0             3-8                          SRB12


N- 5. Added the new commands/active functions execute_string, exs
      and  substitute_arguments, sbag  to separate  "do's" string
      execution   function   from   it's   argument  substitution
      function.

      Added   the   new   requests   execute_string,   exs,   and
      substitute_arguments,                sbag,               to
      ssu_request_tables_$standard_requests,  which is  likely to
      be  used by SSU  subsystems developed at  sites.  Subsystem
      maintainers should  be made aware that  local documentation
      should be  updated to include  the new requests,  or if the
      subsystem explicitly replaces or disables the "do" request,
      that their request tables may need to be updated.

      Added  the -control_string,  -cs, control  argument to  the
      execute_string   command  and   active  function   and  the
      substitute_arguments  command.    The  substitute_arguments
      active function does not  attach special meaning to control
      arguments and will not be changed.

N- 6. Modified the -repeat control argument  of memo to no longer
      repeatedly  apply  new  maturity  date  intervals  until it
      catches up with the present.  It will now apply only to the
      next interval that matures in the future.

      Modified memo so  that the default memo segment  will be in
      the  users home directory  rather than the  default working
      directory.

N- 7. Added  the object_segments and  nonobject_segments commands
      to return only the names of object, or nonobject, segments.
      Similarly,  object_msf  and  nonobject  multisegment files.
      The object_files and nonobject files return names of object
      or nonobject segments and msfs.

N- 8. Added  keywords to  the exists  command/active function  to
      return true if there are any object/non-object files in the
      specified  directory  matching  the  specified  star  name,
      respectively.  The  key words are  object_segments (obseg),
      object_msf (obmsf), object_file (obfile), nonobject_segment
      (nobseg), nonobject_msf (nobmsf), nonobject_file (nobfile).

N- 9. Added the -on, -off, -profile, -escape control arguments to
      the  abbrev  command.   The  -on  control  argument enables
      abbreviation expansion while  -off disables expansion.  The
      -profile  control  argument  changes  the  pathname  of the
      profile segment.  The -escape  control argument changes the
      abbrev escape character.

      Added,  or modified,  the .debug,  .delete, .edit, .escape,
      .forget,  .l,  .la,  .probe,  .profile,  .quit,  .remember,
      .show,  .switch_on,  .switch_off,  .terminate_process,  and
      .use control requests to the abbrev command.

N-10. Modified   the   enter_abs_request    command   to   accept
      non-positional arguments, to allow the -argument as well as
      -arguments control  argument as the long forms  of -ag, and
      to accept multisegment files as absout output.

      The -truncate and -extend arguments  have been added to the
      enter_abs_request command, to effect  the truncation of the
      absentee  request's absout  file when  the request  is run.
      Type "help ear" for usage.

N-11. For   list_abs_requests  -long,   the  new   indicators  of
      'absentee_restarted'   and   'absout_truncation'   will  be
      displayed if  it is a segment,  and may be used  as keyword
      arguments to the user command.

N-12. Two  new keywords  have been  added to  the 'user' program,
      'absentee_restarted', to indicate the absentee job is being
      restarted   due  to  a   system  crash,  and   the  keyword
      'absout_truncation', to  indicate the absentee  request has
      the truncate absout indicator set, each returning 'true' or
      'false' depending on the value of the respective indicator.

N-13. Modified general ready to accept the -fr short name for the
      -frame control argument.

N-14. Modified the  help command to  allow "List of"  sections to
      have multiple  consecutive list item lines  starting in the
      left margin.  Item descriptions are no longer required, but
      if present, must be indented three spaces.

      Modified the  -brief control argument for  the help command
      to  always return some  information, even for  general info
      (gi) segments.

N-15. Installed  the history_comment,   hcom, command  and active
      function to manage software  change documentation in source
      programs.

N-16. Changed   the    -version   control   argument    for   the
      display_subsystem_usage command to  accept starnames.  This
      will  allow a  user to  obtain usage  information on  minor
      versions of a subsystem with one invocation.

N-17. Multiple  -field  control  arguments  to  the  sort_seg and
      sort_strings  commands now  aggregate rather  than override
      each other.

N-18. Added  the   -from,  -to,  -match,  and   -exclude  control
      arguments to the contents  command/active function to allow
      selective  inclusion  or  exclusion  of  lines  in  or from
      output.

N-19. Changed  the  indent  command  to  implement the format_pl1
      convention for specifying comments which are to be changed.
      Comments beginning with /****^ will be copied directly into
      the indented source without modification.

N-20. Added the  reverse_substr command/active function  to count
      characters from right to left.  The returned string has its
      characters in the same order as the input string.

N-21. Added  -force, -no_force, -input_tabs,  and -no_output_tabs
      control  arguments   to  the  canonicalize   command.   The
      canonicalize  command  will  no  longer  delete nonprinting
      characters.   It will  no longer  overwrite input  segments
      unless  the -force  control argument  is used,  or the user
      replies  yes to  a query.   The -tabs  control argument has
      been  changed  to  -output_tabs.   The  old  name  will  be
      retained for at least one release.

N-22. Changed  add_pnotice  to  not  automatically  apply default
      copyrights.    Added  the   -default_copyright  (-dc)   and
      -default_trade_secret (-dts) arguments  to allow specifying
      of default pnotices.

      Changed add_pnotice to issue an  error message if there are
      no existing  pnotices in the  software and if  no arguments
      are specified, i.e., -nm, -dts, or -dc.

      Changed  add_pnotice   to  accept  the  -long   and  -brief
      arguments.  -brief displays nothing.   -long is the default
      and  it displays  the primary  name, without  the "pnotice"
      suffix, of the pnotice that was added.

      Changed  the  pnotice  templates  to  use  a  generic  year
      indicator, <yr>, in place of a specific date; consequently,
      all template  names no longer include the  year.  All sites
      are responsible  for ensuring that their  own pnotices meet
      this  requirement.  Use  list_pnotice_names -check  -all to
      get  a  listing  of  the  valid  template  names  and those
      template names  that have to  be changed to  follow the new
      rules.

      time_info_.cds.  The following changes were made:

      delete  zone  'AHST'  (GMT-10,   Alaska-Hawaii Standard Time)
      add     zone  'HST'   (GMT-10,   Hawaiian Standard Time)

R- 1. Added   -message_status   and   -no_message_status  control
      arguments to the delete_message command to control printing
      of  "All  messages  have  been  deleted"  when  the command
      deletes the last message in the mailbox.

R- 2. Changed  the message_status  command to  work as  an active
      function  returning a  command  string  which will  set the
      current message acceptance state.

R- 3. Added the -acknowledge_if_deferred, -no_update_destination,
      and   -update_destination   control    arguments   to   the

T- 1. Added a  new link type with a  type of 5 and a  class of 6.
      This  new link  is called  a *heap  link and  references to
      variables  defined in  a  user  controlled area  called the
      heap.

T- 2. Added the  list_heap_variables, lhv, command to  return the
      heap  variables  allocated  at  the  current heap execution
      level.

T- 3. Defined a  new type of IPC event  channel, the asynchronous
      event call channel.  A wakeup  sent on this type of channel
      causes  an  IPS  wkp_  signal   to  also  be  sent  to  the
      destination  process.  The  wkp_ signal  handler will cause
      any  call handlers  for  async  event channels,  which have
      pending wakeups, to be run.   This type of event channel is
      especially useful for applications  which interpret data in
      one process and then want to notify another process of some
      important event.  Normally,  the interpreting process would
      send an IPC wakeup.   However, the destination process will
      only  receive the  wakeup when   it goes  blocked.  If  the
      information  should  interrupt   the  destination  process,
      regardless  of  its  blocking  state,  the  new async event
      channel  should  be  used.   Also,  a  new  entry  in ipc_,
      create_event_channel, has been added  to allow the creation
      of wait, call, and async call channels.


_S_u_b_r_o_u_t_i_n_e_s

U- 1. Modified   the  dynamic    linking  mechanism   to  support
      executable  Multi  segment  Files.   Added  the object_lib_
      subroutine  library  to  support  Object  MSFs  as  well as
      standard single  segment objects.  The  initiate entrypoint
      initiates  an  executable  binary  with  a  given  refname,
      forcing  the  refname   if  required.   The  get_def_target
      entrypoint   searches  an   object  segment   for  a  given
      definition and returns a  pointer to the definition target.
      The  get_component_info  entrypoint  returns  pointers  and
      object_info for object segments or MSFs.

U- 2. Added  a series  of entry  points to  manage operations  in
      heap_style  allocation  areas.    These  entry  points  are
      grouped  into the  new heap_manager_  subroutine located in
      bound_heap_manager_.

U- 3. External  pointers can  now be  initialized to  nonconstant
      values via list_init_.  The calling sequence for list_init_
      and  entry points  in set_ext_variable_  have been altered.
      All routines  that use system_link_names.incl.pl1  would be
      recompiled due to a  change to the variable_node structure.
      The name_size field in the  the variable_node has also been
      redefined as fixed bin(21) rather than fixed bin.

U- 4. Deleted  the set_ext_variable_$allocate  entry point.   Any
      program  using this  entry point  should be  changed to use
      set_ext_variable_.

U- 5. Added absentee_restarted  and absout_truncation entrypoints
      to user_info_.  Both require one argument, bit (1) aligned,
      to return the value of the respective PIT bit value.

U- 6. Added  the find_char_  subroutine to  provide an  efficient
      mechanism for doing PL/1  search and verify operations when
      the search/verify  characters are unknown at  compile time.
      Type "help find_char_" for details.

      Renamed  the undocumented  tct_  subroutine  to have  a new
      name, find_char_.  Site specific programs which called tct_
      should  be  changed  to  call  an  entrypoint  in  the  new
      find_char_ subroutine according to the table below:

      tct_ ENTRYPOINT NAME          NEW NAME
      tct_                          find_char_$first_in_table
      tct_$reverse                  find_char_$last_in_table
      tct_$translate                find_char_$translate_first_in_table
      tct_$reverse_translate        find_char_$translate_last_in_table
      tct_$search                   find_char_$first_in_list
      tct_$reverse_search           find_char_$last_in_list
      tct_$verify                   find_char_$first_not_in_list
      tct_$reverse_verify           find_char_$last_not_in_list
      tct_$not_ascii                find_char_$not_ascii_table

      Note  that the   replacement entrypoints  for tct_$reverse,
      tct_$reverse_translate,       tct_$reverse_search,      and
      tct_$reverse_verify return a  standard PL/1 character index
      (character  position  from  the  left  end  of the string),
      whereas  the tct_  entrypoints used  to return  a character
      position  from the  right end   of the  string.  Also,  the
      tct_$quote_search table has been deleted.

U- 7. Added  the find_bit_  subroutine to  efficiently search for
      the first or last on bit ("1"b) or off bit ("0"b) in a long
      bit string.   This routine uses a  more efficient algorithm
      than  PL/1  for  performing  these  specialized  bit string
      search operations.  Type "help find_bit_" for details.

U- 8. Added the  alm_ subroutine interface to  the ALM assembler.
      Added  a  new  pseudo-operation  called  init_link to allow
      users  to join  to the  definition section  of the  object.
      Added support for references to *heap links.

U- 9. Modified the  rcp_priv_$attach gate entry used  for T&D and
      MPC attachments to check for proper discretionary access on
      the device ACS  segments in >sc1>rcp as is  done when using
      rcp_$attach.  The rcp_admin_ and  rcp_sys_ gate entries are
      the only  ones allowed to bypass  ACS segment discretionary
      access checking.

U-10. Extended  the Multics  Star Convention.   Starnames can now
      contain  multiple doublestars,  and components  can contain
      multiple stars.   See starname.gi.info for a  more complete
      description of the extension.

      Modified the  match_star_name_ subroutine to  implement the
      extended  Multics  Star  Convention.   The match_star_name_
      subroutine  can now match  names longer than  32 characters
      and  names containing  null components,  although these are
      not permitted  for file names.   See match_star_names_.info
      for a complete description of the subroutine.

U-11. Added   the   check_star_name_   subroutine   for  flexible
      validation  of starnames,  entrynames, and  pathnames.  The
      old       entrypoints      check_star_name_$entry       and
      check_star_name_$path are  obsolete and should not  be used
      in  new programs.  They  will be retained  indefinitely for
      compatibility.   See check_star_name_.info  for a  complete
      description of the subroutine.

U-12. Changed the error_table_$badstar message to "Invalid syntax
      in starname."  The new codes error_table_$bad_file_name and
      error_table_$null_name_component   have   been   added   to
      diagnose  errors that  were formerly  lumped together  with
      error_table_$badstar's   old  definition,   "Illegal  entry
      name."

U-13. Added the  request_id entrypoint to the  dprint_ subroutine
      to return, in an argument provided by the caller, the fixed
      bin(71) message identifier of the request being enqueued.

U-14. Changed  set_lock_$lock  and  set_lock_$unlock  to  set  up
      condition    handlers     for    no_write_permission    and
      not_in_write_bracket                              returning
      error_table_$no_w_permission.    It  is   recommended  that
      set_lock_  be  used  as   follows  for  applications  where
      efficiency is important:

      if ^stacq (lock_word, static_var_initialized_to_lock_id, ""b)
         then call set_lock_$lock (lock_word, wait_time, code);
         else code = 0;

      if ^stacq (lock_word, ""b, static_var_initialized_to_lock_id)
         then call set_lock_$unlock (lock_word, code);
         else code = 0;

U-15. Added the  get_block_data_info entrypoint to  area_info_ to
      allow  a caller to  step through an  area and look  at each
      block whether allocated or free.

U-16. Changed the discard_ IO module  to accept all opening modes
      and  operations  rather  than  only  output  type modes and
      operations.

U-17. Modified the  print_data_ subroutine to make  it externally
      callable.  This subroutine takes the output of the PL/1 put
      data statement and formats it into a more readable form.

U-18. Added   the   get_command_name   and   get_command_name_rel
      entrypoints to  the cu_ subroutine  to allow access  to the
      command name given on  the command line.  These entrypoints
      were added in support of the C compiler and runtime.

U-19. Added the enter_abs_request_ subroutine to add a request to
      create an absentee process.

U-20. Modified   command_query_   subroutine   to   accept   case
      insensitive user responses to a yes or no question.

U-21. Modified  cv_ptr_ to  allow  the  use of  archive component
      pathnames.

Y- 1. Incompatibably   changed   emacs   to   allow   editing  of
      multisegment files.  The changes required to implement this
      were  extensive.  Users  who have  written extensions  that
      call     undocumented    functions     in    the     module
      e_multics_files_.lisp  will probably   have to  recode them
      because this module was redesigned.

Y- 2. Modified emacs to be more  cautious when writing the buffer
      into  an existing  file:  ^X^S,  save-same-file, and  ^X^W,
      write-file,  with no  pathname will  query if  the file has
      been modified since it was last read into the buffer.  ^X^W
      with a pathname will query if the file already exists.  The
      queries are skipped, and the  old behavior retained, if the
      commands  are given  a numeric  argument or  if the options
      save-same-file-check-dtcm   or   write-file-overwrite   are
      turned on.   The save-same-file-check-dtcm option is  on by
      default  and must  be off   to suppress  the check.   ^X^F,
      find-file, will  query the user  if it finds  the specified
      file already in  a buffer where the file  has been modified
      since it was last read into  the buffer.  This query may be
      prevented,  and the old  behavior retained, by  turning the
      option  find-file-check-dtcm off.   ^XI, insert-file,  will
      set the mark at the beginning of the inserted text.

Y- 3. Modified Emacs  fill-mode and speedtype so that  CR and TAB
      now cause the line to be filled or the word to be expanded,
      respectively, as  is already done by  space and punctuation
      characters

Y- 4. Added support for VersaTerm (tm), version 12.6e, a terminal
      emulator  for the  Apple Macintosh  personal computer.  The
      Emacs ctl versaterm supports VersaTerm(tm) version 2.20 and
      higher.  The Emacs  ctl versaterm210 supports VersaTerm(tm)
      versions  2.10 and lower.   The difference between  the two
      ctls is that versaterm210 does not support proper scrolling
      or 132 column mode.

Y- 5. Added  a history  comment emacs  extension to  allow adding
      history comments  while within the emacs editor.   To add a
      history comment, type:  ESC-X add-hcom CR.

a- 1. New  features  have  been   added  to  the  Executive  Mail
      Facility, version 4.0, in three categories:  new functions,
      improvements to existing functions and changes to menus.

      New  Functions:  Ability to  read mail in  other mailboxes,
      new  options for selecting  messages, an option  to include
      the original in  a reply, the ability to  file the original
      before the reply, and more printing options.

      Improvements  to Existing  Functions:  consistent  behavior
      for  Send, Forward  and Reply,  creation of  a new  profile
      segment if  required, messages marked for  deletion are not
      deleted on cleanup conditions,  more informative help menu,
      and clearer messages and screen presentations.

      Added three new  personalization menus:  Personalization of
      Printing  Options,  Personalization   of  Outgoing  Message
      Options,   and  Personalization   of  Processing   Options.
      Changed  the Personalize  Executive Mail  and General  Help
      menus.

b- 1. Installed  Fortran,  version   12.0b,  which  provides  new
      features and enhancements.

b- 2. Changed Fortran  to return error_table_$noentry  instead of
      fortran_io_error_$status_field_error    when   non-existent
      files are opened with status="old".

b- 3. Changed  the meaning  of Fortran's  "external" statement in
      ansi66  mode.    The  compiler  now   processes  "external"
      declarations of built-in functions in ansi66 mode according
      to  the ANSI-66  (X3.9-1966) standard.   Built-in functions
      which appear in an "external" statement are required by the
      standard to refer to Fortran built-in functions rather than
      user supplied functions.

b- 4. Added the -la_auto, -la_static, -vla_auto, -vla_static, and
      -very_large_common control  arguments to FORTRAN  to enable
      the  selection of  individual storage  classes to  be large
      arrays or  very large arrays.   Added the append  option to
      the status= specifier in OPEN  statements to allow the file
      to  be  positioned  to  the  end  of  the file when opened.
      Changed control argument syntax to allow either -severity N
      or  -severityN  format.   Increased  the  number  of  items
      allowed in a FORMAT statement  from 512 to 1023.  Increased
      the maximum character string size from 256 to 512.


_F_o_r_u_m

c- 1. Installed  Forum version  2.14 which  includes new features
      and numerous bug fixes.

c- 2. Added the  rechain and unchain requests  and forum_$rechain
      entrypoint to the forum subsystem to allow meeting chairman
      to correct transaction chains.

c- 3. Changed  the forum_info  structure  to  accept a  version 2
      structure  which does  not return  the removal_count field.
      This speeds  up the call.  The information  may be obtained
      with the forum_$list_users gate.

c- 4. The list of changed  meetings created by the check_meetings
      request is now available to user applications.

c- 5. Added  the  beforeref,  bref,  transaction  specifier which
      refers  to all transactions  preceeding the current  one in
      the current chain.

c- 6. Added  the -trailer_format  control argument  to the  forum
      command  and the  write and  print requests  to specify the
      format of the trailer line to be returned.

c- 7. Added  the -before  control argument  to the  list_meetings
      request.

c- 8. Added  the  -exclude  and  -from  control  arguments to the
      check_meetings request.

c- 9. Added  the  -brief  and  -long  control  arguments  to  the
      add_meeting and remove_meeting requests.

c-10. Added   the  -current_meeting   control  argument   to  the
      remove_meeting request.

c-11. Added  the  -count  control  argument  to  the next_meeting
      request.

c-12. Added the -no_header control argument to the write request.

c-13. Added  the -no_notify  control argument  and last_seen sort
      type to the list_users request.

c-14. Added       the       forum_$previous_transaction       and
      forum_$next_transaction    gates    to    find   unexpunged
      transactions.

c-15. Deleted the forum_chairman_ gate.   User programs that call
      entries  in  this  gate  should  be  changed  to  call  the
      corresponding entrypoint in the forum_ gate.

d- 1. Changed the  default wait time for the  LINUS, version 4.5,
      set_scope   request   to   be   a   settable  parameter  in
      linus_data_$lock_wait_time.

d- 2. The  LINUS  keywords  select,  from,  where,  union, inter,
      differ,  dup, and  unique  are  now replaceable  with other
      keywords.  To take advantage of  this new feature, edit the
      source  of   linus_lila_tokens_.cds  to  contain   the  new
      keywords,  and then   use the  resulting linus_lila_tokens_
      instead of the Honeywell provided linus_lila_tokens_.

d- 3. The linus assign_values del_scope, list_scope, list_values,
      open,  and set_scope  requests may  now be  used as  active
      requests.  A new active  request, opened_database, has been
      provided.

h- 1. Added Pascal  version 8.03 which incorporates  bugfixes and
      provides new features.

h- 2. Added  the  pascal_cross_reference  command  to  separately
      check  compiled  modules,  object  modules,  for  identical
      variables having unlike declarations.

h- 3. Added the  pascal_display command to display  the execution
      stack and the values of  symbolic variables declared in the
      active Pascal procedures.

h- 4. Modified  Pascal to  be in  closer conformance  to the  ISO
      Pascal standard  definition by including more  precise goto
      usage  control,  checking  for  unallowed  definitions, and
      dynamic verification of function assignments.

h- 5. Enhanced  support  for  inter-language  calls  through  the
      passing of parameter descriptors,  and their values, when a
      Pascal program calls a PL/1 or Fortran procedure.

h- 6. Enhanced  support of  I/O processing  to include  immediate
      output if I/O module is  not vfile_, add end_of_line if not
      present, process  I/O buffer content when  closing I/O, and
      provide dynamic initializing of  files even if MAIN program
      is not called.

h- 7. Provides full support of string variables and types.

i- 1. Multics  Online Work  Station Environment  (MOWSE) provides
      the means  for cooperating processes on Multics  and an IBM
      PC, or  compatible, to communicate  with each other  and to
      exchange requests for information  or processing.  MOWSE is
      designed in such  a way that, given the  limitations of the
      operating systems under which  it operates, these processes
      may  be active  in  the  background while  other foreground
      activities, not necessarily related to MOWSE, take place.

i- 2. MOWSE does not assume that one of the processes is dominant
      over  the  other,  or  that  certain  functionality is only
      available on  one of the machines.  Every  attempt has been
      made   during  the   design   to   ensure  that   the  same
      functionality, in  terms of MOWSE requests,  exists on both
      machines.    Naturally,   the    manner   in   which   this
      functionality is  delivered to, or requested  by, a process
      depends on the operating system that governs the process.

i- 3. The functionality of Background  File Transfer (BFT) exists
      equally  on both  machines, so  transfer operations  can be
      initiated  from  both  the  local  and  the  remote machine
      (either the personal computer or Multics).

i- 4. BFT maintains a store queue and fetch queue on each system.
      These  queues  are  independent  and  contain  no redundant
      information.   The queues  contain only  the requests  that
      were  initiated  on  that  machine.   Due  to  the separate
      queues, cancellation  of a remote  queue entry will  not be
      allowed.  Each queue  will hold one request on  each the PC
      and Multics.

i- 5. All external input to the  BFT program will occur through a
      single MOWSE entrypoint.  On  Multics this MOWSE entrypoint
      will be called via  Multics entrypoints which formulate the
      requests to BFT and provide a more Multics-like interface.

i- 6. If either  the computer or  the network crashes  a recovery
      may be  attempted.  Recovery after a crash  will attempt to
      retransmit the remaining portion of the file that was being
      transferred  at  the  time  of  the  crash.   The  transfer
      recovery is performed by a  simple byte count to adjust the
      pointer in the source file to the same location as the last
      received byte in the destination file.

C- 1. Incompatibly changed the event message information which is
      set  by  tty  when  sending  a  wakeup  to be structured as
      described in net_event_message.incl.pl1.

C- 2. The  structure  used  by  the  undocumented hcs_tty control
      orders  set_echo_break_table  and  get_echo_break_table and
      defined   in   mcs_echo_neg.incl.pl1   has   been   changed
      incompatibly  in order  to allow  echo negotiation  to work
      with characters above 177o.  Specifically, the dimension of
      the pit array named break  has been changed from (0:127) to
      (0:255).   The  new  structure  is  version  2.   Version 1
      structures will be rejected by ring 0.

D- 1. Extended the  do command to allow  use of &0, &r0,  &q0, or
      &control_string   (equivalent  to    &q0)  to   insert  the
      unexpanded control string into the control string.  Because
      the  meaning of  &r&n and   &q&n become  ambiguous when  no
      arguments  are given  (when &n   = 0),  the do  command was
      incompatibly  changed to  make  those  forms an  error; use
      &rf&n and &qf&n instead.

      The behavior  of requoting constructs like  &r1 was changed
      so  that  when  such  constructs  are  consecutive  with no
      intervening space, no spurious quotes are created.

      Added the -abort_line  and -no_abort_line control arguments
      to affect  subsystem behavior.  The default  is -abort_line
      so   that  the   standard  behavior   is  unchanged.   With
      -abort_line, an error in a  request line invoked by do will
      abort not only the request line  invoked by do but also the
      request  line invoking  the  do  command.  Extended  the do
      command to  allow control arguments to  precede the control
      string.    The  control   arguments  apply   only  to  that
      invocation of the do command.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
