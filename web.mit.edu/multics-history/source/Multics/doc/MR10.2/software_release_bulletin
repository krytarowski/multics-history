                          INTRODUCTION




Multics Release  10.2 (MR10.2) is a  complete release and assumes
the prior installation of MR9.1.   That is, the library tapes are
self-supporting and  do not require any  other information to run
Multics.


This  document  includes  descriptions  of  features  included in
previous Multics Releases, MR10.0 and  MR10.1, in addition to the
features included in the current  release, MR10.2.  A notation of
(10.0), (10.1), or (10.2) at  the beginning of an item identifies
the specific release associated with  that item.  This is done as
an aid to sites upgrading from a previous version of the system.


A separate document, Installation  Instructions, is supplied with
the  release tapes.   The Installation  Instructions describe the
contents  of  the  release   tapes  and  include  procedures  for
installation of MR10.2.


Additional  documentation  is  provided with  the  release tapes,
either as printable segments on  the tape (in a special directory
>doc>MR10.2), or as paper copy.


Following  is  a summary  of  the remainder  of sections  in this
document.

     Section 2
          summarizes important highlights.

     Section 3
          describes significant software changes.

     Section 4
          describes incompatible changes.

B- 1. (10.0)  Improved  the method  used  to clear  memory before
      booting Multics for faster system initialization.

B- 2. (10.0)  Rename  the  >sl1  directory at  each  bootload and
      create a new >sl1 directory is created.  This change allows
      the system  to bootload successfully, even  if the old >sl1
      is damaged.  It  also allows segments in >sl1  to be spread
      over all  of the RLV  volumes rather than  residing only on
      the RPV, thereby reducing disk  contention on the RPV.  The
      delete_old_pdds program deletes  the renamed directory once
      the system is up.  The volume salvager deletes any segments
      subordinate to an old >sl1 directory.

B- 3. (10.0) Changed the  CDT to include a permanent  tree of the
      multiplexer  hierarchy.  This  allows multiplexers  to load
      more quickly  as the tree need  not be reconstructed during
      the loading operation.  Quicker loading speeds up answering
      service initialization.

B- 4. (10.0)  Changed the  Multics Storage System  to improve the
      reliability and availability of the system.  The changes in
      MR10.0 allow the system to recover quickly after almost all
      types  of crashes.   The quick  recovery is  implemented by
      software  which  maintains  storage  system  volumes  in  a
      consistent  state,  at all  times, and  allows the  site to
      defer  volume  salvaging  operations  to  a  site-scheduled
      maintenance  period.  (Refer  to Appendix D  for details of
      the changes.)

C- 1. (10.0)  Changed  directory  control to  use  a multireader,
      single-writer  locking  strategy   for  directories.   This
      change improves performance by reducing the lock wait times
      for  directories,  and  eliminates  the  problem  of notify
      timeouts, waiting to lock >udd.

C- 2. (10.0)   Changed   ipc_$block  (actually   fast_hc_ipc)  to
      truncate the user-ring stack in certain situations prior to
      blocking the  process.  The stack is  truncated to the page
      after  the  current  stack_end_ptr.   This  change improves
      performance  by avoiding  disk writes for  pages beyond the
      last stack frame.

C- 3. (10.0)  Changed  hcs_$star_  and  hcs_$status_  to  operate
      without   using   the  hardcore   system_free_seg,  thereby
      reducing  page  faults  taken  in  these  hcs_  primitives.
      Removed system_free_seg from hardcore.

C- 4. (10.0) Changed FNP software to gain efficiency.  The change
      allows FNP throughput rates  of more than 10,000 characters
      per  second per  FNP using  Bisync protocol,  and more than
      20,000  characters  per  second   per  FNP  using  X.25/LAP
      protocols.

C- 5. (10.1)  Redesigned VTOCE  buffer management  to improve the
      efficiency of VTOCE access.  More  wired memory is used for
      VTOCE  buffers  resulting  in considerable  savings  in the
      number  of  VTOCE I/Os.   Each  buffer is  large  enough to
      contain an  entire VTOCE (192 words).   The net increase in
      wired system  memory for VTOCE I/O  is 128 words multiplied
      by the number of VTOCE buffers used.

D- 1. (10.1)  Installed  tape_ioi_ (a  new  tape interface)  as a
      replacement  for  the undocumented  tdcm_  interface.  User
      programs using  tdcm_ should be converted  to tape_ioi_ due
      to   the  improved   functionality,  error   recovery,  and
      performance.   The  tdcm_  interfaces will  continue  to be
      supported  for  the  immediate  future.   Of  the  tape I/O
      modules supplied  with the system, only  the tape_mult_ I/O
      module has been converted to  use tape_ioi_.  The other I/O
      modules will be converted in a future release.

D- 2. (10.1)     Added      the     new     realtime_io_priority,
      realtime_io_deadline,   and    realtime_io_quantum   tuning
      parameters   to  improve   throughput  of   tape  I/O-bound
      processes.  A  site may improve tape  throughput by setting
      realtime_io_priority to ON and  using the default values of
      realtime_io_deadline (0.   seconds) and realtime_io_quantum
      (0.005 seconds).

D- 3. (10.1)  Installed  a  new  version of  the  ted  command to
      provide a new buffer manipulation strategy and incompatibly
      changed the SAFE environments.

      The  new buffer  manipulation strategy makes  better use of
      segments and  significantly reduced the  amount of modified
      pages in disk queues, thereby improving performance.

D- 4. (10.1)  Updated  the buffer  manipulation strategy  used by
      qedx  to  make  better  use of  segments  and significantly
      reduce the number of modified pages in disk queues.

D- 5. (10.2)  Improved  the performance  of  sort_seg, sort_seg_,
      sort_items_,  and  sort_items_indirect_  by  changing  to a
      simpler  sorting  algorithm  which  was  coded  in  ALM  to
      increase efficiency.

E- 1. (10.0) Supports  up to four  IOMs, an increase  of two from
      previous  releases.   The  increased  number  of  IOMs  can
      support   larger   disk  configurations   and   other  high
      performance IO connections.  This  support is restricted to
      the Multics system.   No changes have been made  to the BOS
      operating  system.   Attempts  to  use  BOS  to  access  IO
      channels not  connected to the  first or second  IOM in the
      system  configuration results  in failure.   This means all
      MPCs must be connected to IOM A  or B in order for the SAVE
      and RESTOR  commands to operate.  In  addition, BOS must be
      booted using IOM A.

E- 2. (10.0) Supports operation of an IOM in paged mode.  Support
      is   provided   for   mixed  (paged   and   nonpaged)  mode
      configurations.

      In  paged  mode,  buffers  used  for  IO  can  be allocated
      anywhere  within the  lower order  SCU.  In  nonpaged mode,
      they can  be allocated only  in the lowest 256K  of the low
      order SCU.  Therefore, if a  site has only paged mode IOMs,
      buffers are allocated on noncontiguous pages throughout the
      low order SCU.  This makes it feasible to allocate more and
      larger  IO  buffers,  and contention  for  low-order memory
      space is  reduced.  If a  site has mixed  configuration, or
      only  nonpaged  IOMs,  buffers   must  still  be  allocated
      contiguously in the low 256K.

      Paged mode IOMs are enabled  by specifying a model field of
      NSA on the IOM config  card.  Nonpaged mode is indicated by
      the IOMB model name.

F- 1. (10.0) The PRU1000 printer can  now be used as model number
      1000 instead of 1200.

F- 2. (10.0) Supports MTU0630 tape drives.

F- 3. (10.0)  Removed  support  for  the  IBM  selectric consoles
      (CO8030 and CO8031).

F- 4. (10.1)  Embedded  Unit  Record  Controller  (EURC),  models
      URP8001,  URP8002  and  URP8004  are  now  supported.   The
      following unit  record devices may be  attached through the
      EURC:

                   printers:  PRU0901, PRU1000, PRU1200, PRU1201,
                              PRU1600
               card readers:  CRU0500, CRU1050
         combined card unit:  CCU0401
               card punches:  PCU0120, PCU0121

      The EURC can be used in a mixed configuration with URMPCs.

F- 5. (10.1)  Two  new  printers,   models  PRU0901  and  PRU1201
      (through the new EURC) are now supported.

F- 6. (10.2)  Modified  the  printer   DIM  to  generate  channel
      programs  which  provide improved  performance  for devices
      controlled  by  EURCs.  The  performance  for free-standing
      Unit Record MPCs is not affected by this change.

      Retained    a    copy    of    the    previous    DIM    in
      >system_library_obsolete.   Note  that the  printer daemons
      should  be in  a realtime  work class.   Parameters such as
      initial_quantum and quantum of 0.5 and initial_response and
      response  of   0.1  generally  give   satisfactory  printer
      performance.   (Refer to  the description of  ed_mgt in MAM
      System, Order No.  AK50.)

F- 7. (10.2)  It  is now  possible  to configure  a  Multics tape
      subsystem with  two physical channels, using  the chnl card
      (just as  it is used  for disk subsystems).   This allows a
      site  to  achieve  maximum   redundancy  by,  for  example,
      connecting each physical channel to a different IOM.  (Note
      that   hardware  configuration   requirements  have  always
      required  a  second  physical  channel if  there  were tape
      handlers with  device numbers between 9  and 16 configured,
      but  Multics  would not  make  use of  the  second physical
      channel).   With  this change,  it is  no longer  proper to
      configure a tape MPC with two logical channels per physical
      channel.  There is no performance  benefit in doing so, and
      for   several  reasons,   such  configurations   can  cause
      operational  difficulties.   For  example,  if  two logical
      channels are  configured to a  physical channel, it  is not
      always possible to recover all  of the error status after a
      tape  error.   Also, it  is  possible for  read  errors and
      hardware retries  on one logical channel  to "lock out" the
      other logical channel long enough to cause a timeout.

      An example of the config cards to describe a tape subsystem
      with with two physical channels follows:
         prph  tapa  a  16.  1  630.  2  610.  6  630.  2
         chnl  tapa  b  16.  1
         mpc  mtpa  610.  a  16.  1  b  16.  1

G- 2. (10.0) The  CS also supports  communication channels having
      higher data transfer rates.  Specifically, CS supports:

          CHANNEL NAME            MARKETING ID       DATA RATE

      Broad-Band Bisync (BSC)       DCF6621        up to 72K bps
      Broad-Band HDLC               DCF6622        up to 72K bps
      HDLC                          DCF6620        up to 9600 bps

G- 3. (10.2)  Added CS  support for  HDLC channel  CCITT-V.35 for
      data rates up to 72K bps.  The Marketing ID is DCF6623.

I- 1. (10.0) Installed the RDLABL BOS command to display the name
      of a storage system pack  including a notation of last time
      updated.

I- 2. (10.0) Changed the SAVE and  RESTOR BOS commands to display
      the name  of the target  pack including a  notation of last
      time updated.

I- 3. (10.1) Changed the  size of the CONFIG deck  from a maximum
      of 63 cards to a maximum of 127 cards.

I- 4. (10.2) Changed the BOS directory  size from 83 entries to a
      maximum of 152 entries.

J- 1. (10.0)  Enhanced the  checking of CPU  Data Switches during
      initialization   of    the   bootload   CPU    and   during
      reconfiguration  of  other  CPUs.   A  warning  message  is
      displayed on the  console when the switches are  not set to
      the proper value (010000717200).

J- 2. (10.2)   Installed  changes   to  improve   the  cold  boot
      procedure, provide improved disk error reporting, and clean
      up initialization.

J- 3. (10.2) If an  attempt to load a multiplexer  (other than an
      FNP) which  does not have the  "hardwired" attribute fails,
      the  load is  automatically retried  until either  the load
      succeeds or a dump_mpx command  is issued.  As a result, if
      the multiplexer needs  to be dialed up from  a remote site,
      and the dialup fails, the Multics operator no longer has to
      reload  the  multiplexer  manually  in order  to  allow the
      remote dialup  to be retried.   It is recommended  that any
      multiplexer  that  is  in  fact  hardwired,  be  given  the
      "hardwired" attribute in the CDT.

J- 4. (10.2)  Changed the  CPU config  card image  to include the
      processor  cache  size  following  the cpu  type  and model
      number.   Refer  to the  Multics Operators  Handbook, Order
      Number AM81, for details.

J- 5. (10.2)  Increased  the  dedicated  memory  required  to run
      ISOLTS from 64K to 128K  for DPS8 CPUs to facilitate better
      cache testing.   The memory required  to run ISOLTS  on L68
      CPUs remains at 64K.

K- 1. (10.0) Eliminated the TBLS DBM config card parameter.  With
      this   release  the   size  of   dbm_seg  is   set,  during
      initialization,  to  the maximum  necessary to  support all
      configured disk devices.

K- 2. (10.0) Added a model field to the IOM card to support model
      6000-B IOMs running  in paged mode.  A model  field of IOMB
      indicates a model  6000 IOM running unpaged and  a field of
      NSA indicates a 6000-B IOM running in paged mode.  (See the
      associated Installation Instructions for further details.)

K- 3. (10.0)  Added an  RVTC card to  specify the  number of VTOC
      entries  to  be  placed  on  the  RPV  during  a  BOOT COLD
      operation.  If  this card is omitted,  Multics computes the
      number of VTOCE entries, based upon an average segment size
      of two pages.  Some sites  may find this computed value too
      large for their needs.

K- 4. (10.0)  Changed  the Initializer  to  place a  copy  of the
      config  deck into  syserr log.   The deck  occupies several
      syserr messages, whose text message is "Config deck, part M
      of N".   The binary portion  of the messages  is the binary
      representation  of  the cards  in  the config  deck.   In a
      future release  these messages will be  used by an improved
      device error reporting facility.

K- 5. (10.0) The SALV card keywords CNSL, PDLY, and DUMP keywords
      are  ignored.  Refer  to "Storage  System Enhancements" for
      details on salvager changes.

K- 6. (10.1) The default size of scavenger_data is 70 KW to allow
      one Scavenger to run at a time.  The size of scavenger_data
      may  be adjusted  by means of  the TBLS SCAV  card which is
      documented  in  the  MOH.    Increasing  the  size  of  the
      scavenger_data  may  require  increasing  the  size  of the
      Hardcore  Partition  on  root volumes.   Refer  to "Storage
      System Enhancements" below for details on the Scavenger.

K- 7. (10.1)  The number  of VTOCE  buffers used  is specified by
      means of a PARM configuration  card, with parameters VTB N,
      N being  the number of  VTOCE buffers.  If no  such card is
      present  in the  configuration deck  the default  number of
      VTOCE buffers  is 30.  There  is no limit on  the number of
      VTOCE  buffers which  may be specified.   Refer to "Storage
      System  Enhancements"  below  for details  on  VTOCE buffer
      management.

K- 8. (10.1) Changed the format of the PRPH TAP config card.  The
      new format is:

      PRPH TAPn iom# channel# nchan model1 d1 {...model5 d5}

      Valid model numbers for tape drives are:

           0.        drive does not exist
           500.      MTU0500
           600.      MTU0600
           610.      MTU0610
           630.      MTU0630

      The old parameter "max" is  now specified in the RTDT.  The
      old "nsys" parameter is no longer available.

K- 9. (10.2)  The method  for determining  whether to  inform the
      operator about  discrepancies in the cpu  config card type,
      model, and cache size fields has been changed as follows:

      If the cpu  type, model, and cache size  fields are correct
      on  the  config  card  image  received  from  BOS,  then no
      operator message is displayed.

      If the cpu type, model, and  cache size fields exist on the
      config  card image  received from BOS,  but one  or more of
      these  fields  contains   incorrect  information,  then  an
      operator  message  is  displayed   on  the  system  console
      informing the operator of  the discrepancies.  These fields
      are then corrected for the  corresponding cpu card image in
      the config_deck segment.

      If the cpu type, model, and  cache size fields do not exist
      on  the  config  card  image  received  from  BOS,  then no
      operator message is displayed on the system console.  These
      fields are then added to  the corresponding cpu config card
      image maintained in the config_deck segment.

L- 1. (10.1)     Added      the     new     realtime_io_priority,
      realtime_io_deadline,   and    realtime_io_quantum   tuning
      parameters   to  improve   throughput  of   tape  I/O-bound
      processes.  A  site may improve tape  throughput by setting
      realtime_io_priority to ON and  using the default values of
      realtime_io_deadline (0.   seconds) and realtime_io_quantum
      (0.005 seconds).

L- 2. (10.1)   Added   the   gv_integration   parameter   to  the
      change_tuning_parameters command to control the granularity
      of control  for work class governing.   The default setting
      retains the granularity used in prior releases.

L- 3. (10.1)  Added  the  -int_queue   control  argument  to  the
      tune_work_class   command  to   control  the   use  of  the
      interactive  scheduler queue  by users  in the  work class.
      The default values  are OFF for governed work  class and ON

M- 1. (10.0)  Changed the  Multics Storage System  to improve the
      reliability and availability of the system.  The changes in
      MR10.0 allow the system to recover quickly after almost all
      types  of crashes.   The quick  recovery is  implemented by
      software  which  maintains  storage  system  volumes  in  a
      consistent state at all times  and allows the site to defer
      volume salvaging operations to a site-scheduled maintenance
      period.  (Refer to Appendix D for details of the changes.)

M- 2. (10.0)  Changed  directory  control to  use  a multireader,
      single-writer  locking  strategy   for  directories.   This
      change improves performance by reducing the lock wait times
      for   directories.   Sites   experiencing  notify  timeouts
      waiting to lock >udd will no longer see this problem.

M- 3. (10.0) Eliminated the automatic  hierarchy salvage to depth
      two and three following a physical volume salvage of an RLV
      volume.   This  salvage  proved  ineffective  in  resolving
      hierarchy problems.

M- 4. (10.0)  Changed  the  rebuild_disk  command  to  reduce the
      number   of  VTOCEs   on  a   physical  volume.    This  is
      accomplished  by  truncating  the  VTOC  at  the  high  end
      (discarding VTOCEs  at the end of  the VTOC).  Before using
      rebuild_disk to  truncate a VTOC,  sweep_pv must be  run to
      vacate the portion of the VTOC being truncated.

M- 5. (10.0) Changed the salvagers to  no longer use the printer.
      Messages  which  may  be   important  to  immediate  system
      recovery are  displayed on the BOS  console while those not
      of immediate interest are placed in the syserr log.

M- 6. (10.0) Changed the Volume Retriever to delete the branch if
      an object cannot be successfully retrieved.

M- 7. (10.1) Provided  for the salvage of  physical volumes while
      they are online  and in use by the  system.  The salvage is
      completed  by  a  ring-0  function  called  Scavenger.  The
      Scavenger  performs all  of the  functions of  the Physical
      Volume Salvager.  The Scavenger is  invoked by the "x scav"
      operator command which creates a Daemon process to scavenge
      a specified  volume.  The Scavenger may  also be invoked by
      the scavenge_vol command in any process with hphcs_ access.
      The  "x scav"  and scavenge_vol commands  are documented in
      the MOH.

M- 8. (10.1)  Installed  the  ring-0  segment  scavenger_data  to
      implement a complex bookkeeping  protocol between a running
      Scavenger   and   Multics  Page   Control.   The   size  of
      scavenger_data  determines the  number of  Scavengers which
      may run simultaneously.  The segment contains a header of 1
      KW  in   size.   Each  additional   simultaneous  scavenger
      requires an additional 68KW.

      The default size  of scavenger_data is 70 KW  to allow only
      one Scavenger to run at a time.  The size of scavenger_data
      may be adjusted  by means of the SCAV  argument on the TBLS
      card which  is documented in the  MOH.  Increasing the size
      of  the scavenger_data  may require increasing  the size of
      the Hardcore Partition on root volumes.

      The   Scavenger   is  memory   intensive  and   the  memory
      requirements  listed above  represent the  amount of memory
      which  is  wired  while  the  Scavenger  is  running.   The
      Scavenger  runs  entirely in  ring-0 and  retains processor
      eligibility  for the  length of the  scavenge, usually 5-15
      minutes  per  physical volume.   Running the  Scavenger can
      adversely  affect interactive  users and  it is recommended
      that  the Scavenger  be run  during periods  of light load.
      Use of  the -nopt option is  recommended when the Scavenger
      is run  during periods of  heavier load.  Use  of the -nopt
      option causes the Scavenger to  take longer to complete but
      reduces the effect on other system users.

M- 9. (10.1) With  this release, the following  sizes of Hardcore
      Partitions are recommended:

      RPV = 2500 records

      non-RPV = 2500/N records, where N is the number of physical
      volumes containing Hardcore Partitions.

M-10. (10.1)  Redesigned VTOCE  buffer management  to improve the
      efficiency of VTOCE access.  More  wired memory is used for
      VTOCE  buffers  resulting  in considerable  savings  in the
      number  of  VTOCE I/Os.   Each  buffer is  large  enough to
      contain an  entire VTOCE (192 words).   The net increase in
      wired system  memory for VTOCE I/O  is 128 words multiplied
      by the number of VTOCE buffers used.

M-11. (10.1)  Changed the  vtoc_buffer_meters command  to provide
      information about  utilization of Volume  Table of Contents
      (VTOC) buffers.

M-12. (10.1) Protected the  File Map in the VTOCE  by providing a
      checksum.  The checksum is verified upon activation and the
      segment is  damaged if the  checksum is not  correct.  This
      action is  recorded in the  Syserr Log.  A  Physical Volume
      Scavenge corrects the situation should it occur.

M-13. (10.1)  Changed the  Volume Dumper  to discriminate between
      attach and open errors on  its output volume.  If an attach
      operation fails,  the user is  queried to retry  the attach
      operation.    If  the   user  answers  "no"   the  dump  is
      terminated.  If the user answers "yes" the attach operation
      is retried  with the same  volume.  The errors  on the open
      operation continue  to ask if the  volume should be deleted
      from the pool and if the dump should be continued.

M-14. (10.2)  Changed  the recover_volume_log  command  to accept
      multiple physical volume names  in a single invocation, and
      to  validate  the supplied  name(s) as  being members  of a
      registered logical volume on the system being recovered.
















Contents of MR10.2            3-12                        SRB10.2


M-15. (10.2)  Changed the  Volume Reloader to  allow reloading of
      multiple  physical volumes  in a  single invocation.  Users
      may now specify more that one PVNAME operand to the -pvname
      control  argument  and/or  have  multiple  -pvname  control
      arguments  to  the reload_volume  command.   When reloading
      more than  one physical volume in  a single invocation, the
      use of -disk_model and -no_detach are prohibited.

      An  implementation restriction  requires that  all physical
      volumes (with  the exception of the  RPV) be reloaded using
      the correct Volume Registration information.  Therefore, if
      an RPV and  other physical volumes are to  be reloaded, the
      reload  of  the  RPV   must  be  accomplished  first.   The
      remainder  of  the physical  volumes  may then  be reloaded
      together.  It is anticipated  that this restriction will be
      removed in a future release.

M-16. (10.2)  Changed  the   incremental_volume_dump  command  to
      accept  a  -detach control  argument  to specify  that dump
      volumes be detached after each pass.  Additionally, removed
      the  -no_detach  control   argument  to  the  (consolidated
      complete)_volume_dump commands.

M-17. (10.2)  Changed  the directory  locking strategy  to record
      read  locks  in the  dir_lock_seg.   This replaces  the old
      dirlockt_seg.

M-18. (10.2) Upgraded  the manage_volume_pool command  to support
      volume sets and expiration dates.   USE of this new version
      of  the command  IRREVOCABLY CHANGES  the structure  of the
      volume  pool   segment.   Type  "help   mvp"  for  detailed
      information.

M-19. (10.2) Changed the msf_manager_ entries that manipulate the
      access control  list on an  MSF to force access  to the MSF
      directory.   Programs  which  call  these  entries  will no
      longer have to force access themselves.

M-20. (10.2)  This release  provides limited  general support for
      segments of maximum length  256K words.  256K word segments
      are intended  for use only  for FORTRAN Very  Large Arrays.
      With  MR10.2,  any user  may  set the  maximum length  of a
      segment  to  256KW   by  calling  hcs_$set_max_length;  the
      set_max_length command  enforces a 255 KW  limit.  In order
      to connect to such a segment (i.e., successfully complete a
      segment  fault   on  the  segment),  the   user  must  call
      hcs_$set_256K_switch  or  use   the  new  process_switch_on
      command  to  allow use  of  256K segments  in  the process.
      General support for 256KW segments is limited to:  hardcore
      support and  hierarchy and volume  dumper/reloader support.
      In general,  commands and subroutines  may malfunction when
      attempting to reference the last page of a 256KW segment.

N- 1. (10.0)  Changed  the  access  required  to  install  system
      tables.  Installation of the cdt, mgt, rtdt, and sat tables
      is  controlled by  the submitters'  effective access  to an
      access  control  segment,  <table_name>.install.acs.  These
      access control  segments MUST reside  in >system_control_1.
      This change allows site  personnel to restrict write access
      to the actual tables so  that persons authorized to install
      the tables cannot accidentally modify them.

N- 2. (10.0) Changed  the format of the  publicly accessible user
      table >sc1>whotab.   The change is effected  in a way which
      does  NOT require  the recompilation of  programs which use
      this table.  The  size of the table header  is increased by
      reserving  a  number  of  user entries  for  use  as header
      fields.   These  user  entries   are  logically  empty  and
      therefore  are   ignored  by  programs   which  honor  this
      convention.

N- 3. (10.0)  Added  warning controls  to the  Project Definition
      Table (PDT) which are triggered by user spending and cutoff
      dates in  addition to existing mechanisms  based on project
      spending  and  cutoff dates.   The  defaults, also  used by
      cv_pmf, are:  User_warn_days:   10; User_warn_percent:  10;
      User_warn_dollars:  10.

N- 4. (10.0) Changed  the master.ec segment in  >tools to use the
      new  qedx  control  arguments  -pathname  and  -no_rw_path.
      These   control  arguments   prevent  the   limited  system
      administrator from reading  and writing arbitrary segments.
      The  system  administrator   should  examine  the  supplied
      exec_com   and   update   the   site's   copy   located  in
      >udd>SysAdmin>admin>lib appropriately.

N- 5. (10.1)  Renamed  the  admin  subroutine  to  admin_.   This
      subroutine  processes many  operator commands.   Sites that
      have exec_coms (such as system_start_up.ec, admin.ec, etc.)
      that contain commands of  the form "admin$xxx" MUST replace
      them with commands of the form "sc_command xxx".

N- 6. (10.1) Installed a new version  of the Answering Service to
      redisplay the  login banner when the  banner changes (e.g.,
      going  from  special session  to  standard service)  and to
      display  the  channel name  in the  login banner.   The new
      version also adds per-user default login ring specification
      in  the  PDT,  and  changes  create_homedir_  to  set  ring
      brackets to 7,7.

N- 7. (10.1) Changed  Answering Service to allow  access to login
      channels to  be restricted, using  Access Control Segments.
      Following an unsuccessful attempt to use a restricted line,
      the line  is hungup rather than  allowing repeated attempts
      to login or allowing the normal timeout interval.

N- 8. (10.1)  Changed  the adddev  command  to correctly  set the
      characteristics  of a  tape drive which  was offline during
      system initialization.

N- 9. (10.1)  Changed  the cv_cmf,  cv_pmf, cv_rtmf,  cv_smf, and
      cv_ttf   translators   to  process   segments   having  the
      appropriate  suffix.   The respective  suffixes  are:  cmf,
      pmf, rtmf,  smf, and ttf.   The cv_XXX command  first looks
      for the  segment source.XXX, and  if found, the  segment is
      translated  and  the output  placed in  source.TABLE, where
      TABLE is the appropriate suffix.   If the source segment is
      not found,  the command looks  for the segment  source.  If
      found,  a  warning message  is  issued and  the  segment is
      converted as with prior  releases.  This compatibility will
      be  removed  in a  future release.   Project administrators
      should   rename  their   PMF  segments  or   add  the  name
      <Project>.pmf to  existing segments so there  is no need to
      change typing habits or exec_coms.

N-10. (10.1)  Changed  the  cv_pmf, cv_cmf,  cv_ttf,  cv_smf, and
      cv_rtmf  translators   to  accept  the   -severity  control
      argument.  Also provided each with severity active function
      support.

N-11. (10.1)  Changed  the  cv_cmf, cv_pmf,  cv_rtmf,  and cv_ttf
      translators  to no  longer delete  the output  segment just
      because translation failed.  Users  should use the severity
      active  function  to  determine whether  a  translation was
      successful.

N-12. (10.1)  Added  the   -no_password_info  and  -password_info
      control   arguments   to   the   print_pnt   command.   The
      -password_info  control  argument   is  the  default.   The
      control  arguments  determine   whether  information  about
      good/bad  passwords  and  the  date of  password  change is
      displayed or suppressed.

N-13. (10.1)  Installed  the   set_mc_message_limits  command  to
      control the display of messages by the message coordinator.

N-14. (10.1)  Changed  the  method   of  storing  the  admin-mode
      password.  The password is stored in >sc1>communications as
      a  char (8)  value.   Prior  to MR10.1,  it  was  stored in
      directly readable  form.  The first time  MR10.1 is booted,
      the     find_communications_seg_     subroutine    converts
      >sc1>communications  from  version  1 to  version  2.  This
      change  consists  entirely of  scrambling the  password and
      changing the version number.  If  it is necessary to revert
      to MR10.0,  precautions must be taken  to ensure entry into
      admin  mode.   This  can be  accomplished  by:  temporarily
      adding an entry to admin.ec such as:

          &label execute
          &rf1
          &quit

      This enables  entering commands in  admin mode even  if the
      admin command  cannot be used and  allows emergency repairs
      (e.g.,   "x   execute   rename   perm_syserr_log   =.bad").
      Alternatively, a  copy of >sc1>communications  must be made
      before booting MR10.1 and  restore that copy before booting
      MR10.0.  The password  is at locations zero and  one (0 and
      1); the version is at location 12 (twelve, octal).

N-15. (10.2) Changed pre_empt sampling to no longer cause serious
      performance  degradations on  one or two  CPU systems.  The
      default value may now be used for such configurations.

N-16. (10.2)  Removed the  salv entry  of the  admin.ec since the
      command  it   uses  (copy_salvager_output)  is   no  longer
      available.

N-17. (10.2) Changed  the Daemon logout, via  the operator logout
      command, to  use the trm_ subroutine  protocol.  This means
      the daemon epilogue handler, if  any, is invoked, as is the
      case for all other process terminations or logouts.

O- 1. (10.0)   Changed   ipc_$block  (actually   fast_hc_ipc)  to
      truncate the user-ring stack in certain situations prior to
      blocking the  process.  The stack is  truncated to the page
      after  the  current  stack_end_ptr.   This  change improves
      performance  by avoiding  disk writes for  pages beyond the
      last stack frame.

      Note  that  this change  may expose  some coding  errors in
      users' programs that had not been evident in the past.  For
      example,  a FORTRAN  program which is  incorrectly coded to
      depend  upon  an  automatic  variable  retaining  its value
      across subroutine calls now  fails.  In prior releases, the
      program might  have executed without apparent  error if the
      subroutine's stack frame were  located at the same position
      on the stack.

O- 2. (10.0)   Changed   handling   of   the   storage  condition
      (out_of_bounds  on  the  user's stack)  to  provide clearer
      diagnostic messages.  The storage  condition is raised only
      when the stack is truly exhausted.  An attempt to reference
      beyond the end  of the last stack frame  is signalled as an
      out_of_bounds condition.

O- 3. (10.0) Changed  the calling sequence of  sub_err_ to take a
      flag word  of bits rather  than single character  flags for
      action  codes.  For  compatibility, sub_err_  still accepts
      the old character flags.

O- 4. (10.1)  Removed  support   for  v1pl1.   The  pl1_operators
      operator segment  for programs compiled with  the Version 1
      PL/1 compiler  will be moved to  >obsolete in MR10.2.  User
      programs which have not been  compiled since 1972 should be
      recompiled.

O- 5. (10.1) Changed the pl1_operators_ subroutine to support the
      use  of profile  for object segments  with separate static.
      Removed references to nonexistent pl1 io entry points.

O- 6. (10.1)  Changed  the link_trap_caller_  subroutine  to call
      trap procedures with  a null pointer for a  0 arg link relp
      rather than a pointer to the base of the linkage section.

O- 7. (10.1)  Changed  timer_manager_  to   be  able  to  pass  a
      caller-supplied  data pointer  to programs  which handle an
      alarm_ or cpu-call.

O- 8. (10.1)  Added  the  feature   of  invoking  a  reconnection
      exec_com, reconnect.ec,  to tailor the  process environment
      when   connecting   to   a   disconnected   process.   Upon
      reconnection,  the  handler for  the  reconnection searches
      first in the user's home directory, then the user's project
      directory,  and  finally  in  >system_control_dir  for  the
      exec_com.   If found,  the exec_com  is invoked  to perform
      reconnection funtions such as resetting terminal modes.

O- 9. (10.1)     Installed     the     reconnect_ec_enable    and
      reconnect_ec_disable commands to search, or not search, for
      the reconnection exec_com.  The reconnect_ec_enable command
      is   in    effect   by   default    for   processes   using
      process_overseer_ or project_start_up_ overseers.

O-10. (10.2)  Installed  PL/1  Release  28d which  is  a complete
      compiler  installation.  Several  new features  were added.
      Type "help pl1.new_features" for complete details.

O-11. (10.2) Changed the abbreviation  processor to recognize the
      archive  component  pathname  delimiter  (::)  as  a  break
      sequence.   As  a  consequence  of this  change,  abbrev no
      longer  expands  any  abbreviation  whose  name  contains a
      double colon.  Added the .rename request to abbrev to allow
      users to rename any such  abbreviations so they are able to
      continue to use them.

P- 1. (10.0) Changed the operator  console management software to
      improve  operation.   Some  of  these  changes  affect  the
      appearance  of output  on the  console.  For  example, some
      prompting  messages are  no longer  followed by  a carriage
      return  (i.e.,  the  cursor  remains  positioned  after the
      prompt).   Nonprinting characters  are translated  to octal
      escape sequences (e.g., \034).

P- 2. (10.1)  Changed the  algorithm used  to compress successive
      identical  syserr  messages  to  the  string  "=".   If the
      console beeper is activated by the message, the compression
      does not take place.

P- 3. (10.2)  Installed  a new  operator console  support package
      that  offers  dynamic console  recovery in  console failure
      situations.   The  new  software  requires  that  the  site
      replace the PRPH OPC card with the following card:

           PRPH OPC<tag> IOM CHNL MODEL LINE_LENG STATE

      One card  should be inserted into  the config_deck for each
      configured console.  The state field may contain one of the
      following  values:   ON  for  the  single,  in  use, system
      console; OFF to specify an  existing console that is not to
      be used as an alternate  console; INOP to specify a console
      known  to be  broken and  is normally  assigned dynamically
      during  console recovery;  and ALT for  a console available
      for use if the primary  console fails.  For a more detailed
      discussion  see  Section  4   of  the  MR10.2  Installation
      Instructions.

P- 4. (10.2)  Modified  the  ocdcm_  console DIM  to  display the
      string  "(output discarded)"  at the beginning  of the next
      line  after  an operator  has  discarded the  output  of an
      operator entered  request, to provide  a visible indication
      that such an event has occurred.  The console then responds
      with  the  next READ,  indicated by  the prompt  on CSU6601
      consoles, or the INPUT light on CSU6000 series consoles.

P- 5. (10.2)  Provided  a new  PARM  to control  console software
      actions in the event of console recovery failure.  The CCRF
      field  on the  parm card  can be  used to  specify that the
      system should crash if console recovery is unable to locate
      a working alternate console  and the Message Coordinator is
      not in use.  Consult the Multics Operators' Handbook, Order
      Number AM81, for more details.

      Site  maintainers  should be  aware  that if  the  Crash on
      Console Recovery  Failure option has  been selected, either
      by presence  of the CCRF parameter  on the config_file PARM
      card or the usage of the set_system_console -crash, and the
      bootload console is deconfigured via the set_system_console
      command Multics will crash with the message:

           ocdcm_  (reconfigure):  Bootload  console deconfigured
      with CCRF set.

      This   command   is   documented   in   MAM   AK50,  System
      Administration.  See that manual for more details.

P- 6. (10.2) Although  it is possible  to specify a  console line
      length, care  should be taken with  line lengths of greater
      than  80  characters  when  utilizing  the  CSU6601  series
      consoles.  It is possible that line lengths of more than 80
      characters may  cause buffer overflow.   Repeated overflows
      will result  in the console  being marked INOP  and removed
      from service.  If  the site suspects this to  be a problem,
      the console may be brought back  on line through use of the
      set_system_console command.

R- 1. (10.0 and  10.1) Changed the  Multics Communications System
      (CS)  to support  connection to a  packet switching network
      through  an   interface  complying  with   the  1980  CCITT
      Recommendation X.25.  This includes  the X.28, X.29 and X.3
      protocols.  The hardware connection  for an X.25 network is
      made through a single HDLC channel.

      The following new features were added to the X.25 software:

     ox    When  calling  a  Multics  system  using  X.25,  it  is
          possible to select a channel service type (either login
          or  slave)  by using  the call-data  field of  the call
          request packet.

     ox    The X.25 software provides full CS metering functions.

     ox    The X.25  software is certified for  operation with the
          TYMNET network.

      For details on  the use of the X.25  protocol, refer to MAM
      Communications (Order No.  CC75).

R- 2. (10.0) Changed FNP software to improve its efficiency.  The
      change  allows  FNP throughput  rates  of more  than 10,000
      characters  per second  per FNP using  Bisync protocol, and
      more  than  20,000  characters  per  second  per  FNP using
      X.25/LAP protocols.

R- 3. (10.0) Changed FNP software to  support data rates of up to
      72K bits per  second for synchronous lines and  up to 19.2K
      bits per second for asynchronous lines.

R- 4. (10.1) Froze  software support for the  Datanet 355 (DN6632
      models)  at the  MR10.0 level.   New FNP  features are only
      available  on  the  Datanet  series 6678  FNPs  (DN6651 and
      DN6661)  having at  least 64K words  of FNP  memory.  A new
      system  library,  >ldd>355,  with a  parallel  structure to
      >ldd>mcs, contains versions of all FNP modules which run on
      the DN6632 and on DN6678 models with less than 64K words of
      memory.

R- 5. (10.1)  Changed  the FNP  software  to allocate  buffers at
      addresses above 32K words.  This change allows use of up to
      256K words of  memory, the full complement.  On  a 64K word
      FNP, it  is no longer  advisable to use a  very large trace
      buffer,  since the  space thus occupied  would otherwise be
      available for the buffer pool.   A size of approximately 4K
      to  6K  words is  recommended, depending  on the  number of
      channels configured.

R- 6. (10.1) Changed  FNP software to allow  the configuration of
      the FNP DIA on any of the FNP  IOM channels 3, 4 , 5, or 14
      (octal).   The FNP  can only  be accessed  by one  of these
      channels on  a given Multics System.   However, the FNP can
      be cabled  into several different Multics  systems (e.g., a
      production  system  and a  test  system) using  a different
      channel for  each system providing that  only one system is
      using the FNP at a  time.  Sites were previously restricted
      to using only channel 4.

R- 7. (10.1)   Changed   some   internal   interfaces   used   by
      multiplexers to allow the  recovery of masked FNP channels.
      Sites  that use  site-supplied multiplexers  are advised to
      see the detailed discussion of changes in Appendix E.

R- 8. (10.1)  Installed  an  MCS  timer facility  for  ring-0 MCS
      multiplexers.  Entrypoints  to mcs_timer are  documented in
      the  Communication  System  SDN,  Order  Number  AN85.  The
      x25_mpx contains an example of mcs_timer use.

R- 9. (10.2) Added  the collect parameter  to the additional_info
      field of the terminal  type definition for X.25 multiplexer
      channels.    If  the   parameter  is  set   to  "yes",  the
      non-default   value,   outgoing  call   requests   made  on
      subchannels for  that channel specify  the reverse charging
      user facility.   This results in  charging the call  to the
      host being called, rather than the caller.

R-10. (10.2) Certified level 2 and  level 3 Multics X.25 software
      with TELENET.

R-11. (10.2) Certified level 2 and  level 3 Multics X.25 software
      with UNINET.

R-12. (10.2)   Added  the   packet_threshold  parameter   to  the
      additional_info field  of the terminal  type definition for
      X.25 multiplexer  channels.  If the  parameter is set  to a
      non-default  value,  the multiplexer  will not  send output
      packets  with a  length of packet_threshold,  or longer, if
      there  are  any shorter  packets  queued for  output.  Also
      added  the set_x25_packet_threshold  administrative command
      to  allow  the  value  of   this  parameter  to  be  varied
      dynamically on a per-multiplexer  basis.  The current value
      of the parameter  can be obtained by means  of the tty_dump
      command.  The purpose of this  parameter is to optimize the
      processing  of  short  packets,  in  an  environment  where
      individual characters  are being echoed over  a network and
      lengthy delays interfere with input.

S- 1. (10.0) Changed the  CDT to allow baud rates  of up to 72000
      for synchronous channels (Bisync and HDLC protocols) and up
      to 19200 for asynchronous channels.

S- 2. (10.0) Changed the  CDT to include a permanent  tree of the
      multiplexer  hierarchy.  This  allows multiplexers  to load
      more  quickly  because  the  tree   does  not  have  to  be
      reconstructed   during  the   loading  operation.   Quicker
      loading speeds up answering service initialization.

      As part of this change, the answering service automatically
      checks    the   consistency    of   CDT    entries   during
      initialization.  If an inconsistency  is found, messages to
      the console indicate:  the  existence of the inconsistency;
      the  channels   deleted  or  added   during  the  resultant
      salvaging  of  the CDT;  and  completion of  CDT salvaging.
      Note that when the damaged switch  is found ON for the CDT,
      salvaging     occurs     automatically     during    system
      initialization.   Therefore,  site  procedures  should  not
      routinely turn off this  switch until the answering service
      is completely initialized.

T- 1. (10.0) Modified most terminal type definitions to include a
      can_type  mode  specification   of  can_type=overstrike  or
      can_type=replace.  Added can_type=replace  mode to the mode
      string in  the TTF entry  for those terminals  that replace
      overstruck characters.

T- 2. (10.0)    Added    new    terminal    types:     BANTAM550,
      DIABLO1640_OSR_10C6L_CONSOLE,            NEC5525_OSR_OFLOW,
      TI940_80C_OFLOW, TI940_132C_OFLOW, and TVI912

T- 3. (10.0)   Added   terminal   types:    DG132A,   DG132A_60L,
      DG132A_120L, DG132B, DG132B_60L,  and DG132_120L supporting
      the Datagraphix 132 terminal.  The DG132A terminal types do
      not have function keys while the DG132B terminal types have
      function keys.

T- 4. (10.0) Added  terminal types:  H19 and  Z19 as synonyms for
      the HEATH19.

T- 5. (10.0)    Added   terminal    types:    LAP_DTE,   LAP_DCE,
      LAP_TELENET,  X25_DATAPAC,   X25_TYMNET,  X25_TELENET,  and
      X25_TRANSPAC supporting X.25 multiplexer connections.

T- 6. (10.0) Added video tables to the AJ510 terminal type.

T- 7. (10.0)  Added function  key specifications  for the TVI940,
      TVI950, VT100, VT100_OFLOW,  VT100W, VT100W_OFLOW, VT100WS,
      VT132, VT132_OFLOW, VT132_80C, and VT132_80C_OFLOW terminal
      types.

T- 8. (10.1) Changed the TTF to include additional terminal types
      and  made  enhancements to  several others  terminal types.
      The new terminal types are:

           ADM1                          NL7009
           ASCII_PRINTER_OSR             SUPERBRAIN
           BITGRAPH                      TDV2220
           DTC300S_12C

      Added  support  for  four  Hewlett-Packard  Model  26xx CRT
      terminal  types (HP2621,  HP2622, HP2623,  and HP2648).  No
      distinction  is made  among these  types in  the TTF (i.e.,
      they are treated identically).

      Changed the  VIP7205 entry to include  an appropriate modes
      statement.

      Corrected  the  initial string  for  the DTC300S  which was
      setting 15 tabs.

      Removed  the  LAP  terminal  types  LAP_DCE,  LAP_DTE,  and
      LAP_TELENET since the  LAP level support of the  X.25 is in
      the FNP.

      Changed the initial string for the INFOTON100 terminal type
      entry.

T- 9. (10.2)  Added  ten  new   terminal  types,  and  seven  new
      answerbacks  and  other enhancements  to TTF.ttf.   The new
      terminal types are:

      LA120_12C6L
           Digital Equipment LA120 DECwriter  III as line printer
           at 12 chars/inch, 6 lines/inch.
      TI787
           Texas Instruments Model 787.
      VIP7201
           Honeywell VIP 7201.
      VT100S
           Digital Equipment Model VT-100  (24 lines, 80 columns)
           without advanced video.
      VT102, VT102_80C
           Digital Equipment Model VT-102 using 80 columns.
      VT102_OFLOW, VT102_80C_OFLOW
           Same as VT102 but with output flow control enabled.
      VT102_132C
           Same as VT102 but configured with 132 columns.
      VT102_132C_OFLOW
           Same  as  VT102_132C  but  with  output  flow  control
           enabled.

      The seven added answerbacks are:

                XTI787              for       TI787
                XVT100S             for       VT100S
                XVT102_80C          for       VT102_80C
                XVT102_80C_O        for       VT102_80C_OFLOW
                XVT102_132C         for       VT102_132C
                XVT102_132C_O       for       VT102_132C_OFLOW
                7201                for       VIP7201

U- 1. (10.0)  Changed  the  bind_fnp  command  to  check  for the
      presence of meters module if metering is enabled by default
      or if  the "meter:  yes"  statement is present  in the bind
      file.  If metering is enabled and the meters module absent,
      then binding fails.

U- 2. (10.0) Added an  idle loop to the FNP  scheduler to allow a
      more  complete metering  of FNP  idle time.   Installed the
      meter_fnp_idle and display_fnp_idle  commands to record FNP
      idle time at specifiable  intervals and display accumulated
      data.

U- 3. (10.0)  Added the  trace_mcs command  to display  MCS trace
      table entries and control the MCS tracing facility.

V- 1. (10.0 and 10.1)  Fixed bugs in CS output  flow control that
      caused  terminal output  for user A  to appear  on user B's
      terminal.

V- 2. (10.1)   Installed  bound_as_mpx_   and  bound_comm_meters_
      subroutines to provide X.25  support.  The support includes
      implementation of LAPB protocol and the handling of all I/O
      buffering in the FNP.

W- 1. (10.0)  Changed  the  enter,  enterp  and  login  preaccess
      requests   to  recognize   the  -arguments   (-ag)  control
      argument.   The  -ag  control  argument  must  be  the last
      control  argument  to  access  requests  as  all  arguments
      following it are taken as  arguments to the process.  Added
      the login_args command/active function to display or return
      information about  selected login arguments.   Refer to the
      MPM Commands (Order No.  AG92) for more information.

W- 2. (10.0) Added the -long (-lg) and -warning control arguments
      to the  login preaccess request.  The  -lg control argument
      reverses  the effect  of -brief  and -warning  reverses the
      effect of -no_warning.

W- 3. (10.0)  Changed  the  processing  of  interactive  and card
      passwords to  define a legal password  as being one through
      eight  characters.   A  character  may  be  printing  ASCII
      graphic   except  space   and  semi-colon.    Backspace  is
      permitted  and   counts  as  one   character.   Users  with
      passwords longer than eight  characters are warned at login
      that  some characters  in their password  are ignored.  The
      warning  message can  be avoided  by typing  only the first
      eight password characters.

W- 4. (10.0) The Answering Service no longer creates missing home
      directories  when  a  user  logs  in.   If  a  user's  home
      directory is deleted or  missing, the Project Administrator
      must create the directory.  The Answering Service continues
      to create home directories when a  user is added to the PDT
      for a project.

W- 5. (10.2)  Changed the  request for  password during  login to
      notify the user when it is  safe to type the password.  The
      dialup_  subroutine  displays  the  password  prompt before
      masking   the  terminal.    Terminals  which   support  the
      printer_off  order  are  masked  prior  to  display  of the
      new_line.   Terminals which  do not support  this order are
      masked simultaneously with  the transmitted new_line (i.e.,
      as a single group of characters).

X- 1. (10.0)  Changed  the  contents  active  function  to accept
      archive pathnames.

X- 2. (10.0)  Changed  the   print_link_info  command  to  accept
      archive pathnames.

X- 3. (10.0)  Changed  the pathname  manipulation commands/active
      functions (path, directory,  entry, strip, strip_entry, and
      equal_name) to recognize archive pathnames.

X- 4. (10.0)  Changed  the path  command/active function  to take
      optional  second  and third  arguments  to form  an archive
      pathname.   When  the  optional arguments  are  given, they
      specify the directory, entryname,  and component name parts
      of an archive pathname.

X- 5. (10.0)    Added    the   component    and   strip_component
      commands/active  functions   to  operate  on   the  archive
      component  name portion  of the  pathname analogous  to the
      operation  of  entry  and   strip_entry  on  the  entryname
      portion.  The operation of component and strip_component is
      identical  to  that  of  entry and  strip_entry  when their
      argument is not an archive pathname.

X- 6. (10.0)   Added  the   is_component_pathname  command/active
      function which returns true if  the pathname argument is an
      archive component pathname.

X- 7. (10.0) Added the  entry_path command/active function which,
      when  given  an  archive  pathname,  returns  the  absolute
      pathname  of  the  archive  (i.e., it  removes  the archive
      component name from the archive pathname).


_M_e_t_e_r_i_n_g _T_o_o_l_s


Y- 1. (10.0)  Enhanced  the  meter_rcp command  to  accept device
      names and resource types of up to 32 characters in length.

Y- 2. (10.0) Added the hc_pf_meters command to display the number
      of page faults taken on hardcore segments.

Y- 3. (10.0) Added an  idle loop to the FNP  scheduler to allow a
      more  complete metering  of FNP  idle time.   Installed the
      meter_fnp_idle and display_fnp_idle  commands to record FNP
      idle time at specifiable  intervals and display accumulated
      data.

Y- 4. (10.0)  Added the  trace_mcs command  to display  MCS trace
      table entries and control the MCS tracing facility.

Y- 5. (10.1)  Added  the  vtoc_buffer_meters  command  to provide
      information about  utilization of Volume  Table of Contents
      (VTOC) buffers.

Y- 6. (10.2) Changed  the trace command to  produce more accurate
      meters.  Meters  produced by the MR10.2  command may not be
      compared  to  meters for  the same  script reported  by the
      trace_meters command in prior  releases.  The TOTAL line of
      the  trace_meters report  should be  about the  same as the
      ready line after running the same script without metering.

      Changed the  structure of the trace  table to provide fixed
      bin (53) fields for real time and vcpu time accumulators in
      order to remove the 19 hour restriction.  Private copies of
      trace  or  the  trace_meters   command  must  be  upgraded.
      Documentation of trace, at one  time, showed how to replace
      trace_print_ with  a private tracing  procedure.  If anyone
      uses  this  feature, it  will  be necessary  to  modify the
      tracing procedure.

      Added   the  LVCPU/CALL   field  to   the  format   of  the
      trace_meters   report  to   give  the   average  number  of
      microseconds, per  call, of virtual cpu  time spent in each
      procedure.   Columns  previously  headed with  CPU  are now
      headed VCPU,  and columns previously headed  with PWS (page
      waits) are now headed PF (page faults).


_O_n_l_i_n_e _T_e_s_t_i_n_g


Z- 1. (10.0) Added the -pathname  control argument to the extract
      command to allow the user  to specify an optional directory
      in which to find online  FDUMPS.  FDUMPS are kept in >dumps
      by default.

Z- 2. (10.1) Added a  version of MCLT to support  256K FNP memory
      management.

Z- 3. (10.1) Added three new MOLT's  test requests:  mtg for tape
      shotgun,  mtc  for  tape  compatability, and  mdc  for disk
      confidence.   The  requests  are  entered  in  the standard
      MOLT's  format with  the test id  being mtgICCDD, mtcICCDD,
      and mdcICCDD where I is the  iom, CC is the channel, and DD
      is the device.

      NOTE:   Running MOLTS  MDRs on  any device  connected to an
      EURC  affects operation  of other devices  connected to it.
      Consequences  of operating  the other  devices vary between
      devices  (e.g.,  VFU image  may  be affected  for printers,
      ioi_timer  messages, garbaged  printouts, bad  data on card
      input, etc.).

Z- 4. (10.1) Installed the display_cpu_error  command to scan the
      syserr  log  and  display  machine  conditions  and history
      registers.

Z- 5. (10.2)   Added  the   -patches  control   argument  to  the
      load_tandd_library  command  to allow  for reading  of IFAD
      tapes  that contain  patches that  might have  records with
      ZERO checksums.

Z- 6. (10.2)  Installed the  analyze_multics command  to invoke a
      subsystem  that permits  the scanning of  a Multics address
      space  for  analysis.  The  dumps  search list  is  used to
      locate  FDUMPs.   If  a  dumps search  list  is  not found,
      analyze_multics will use only >dumps  in the search list as
      the  default.  If  additional search paths  are desired the
      add_search_paths command must be used to define them.

Z- 7. (10.2) Changed  TOLTS to allow  a user to  communicate with
      the operator via the msg request.  If the message ends with
      a "?"  the  operator is prompted to reply.   If the message
      does not end with a "?"  it is simply a message sent to the
      operator console.

      Modified TOLTS  to allow displaying  partial configuration.
      If  the  request 'test  pcd'  is requested  from  a process
      running  polts,  only  those   devices  running  polts  are
      displayed.  If the request 'test  pcd dsk' is entered, then
      the entire disk config is  displayed.  If the request 'test
      pcd  tapa'  is  entered,  then  only  tapa  config  info is
      displayed.

      Modified  TOLTS_  to  allow  MDR testing  of  non-logical 0
      channels.   This  will  permit  MDR testing  of  any device
      through any connected channel.

      Modified  Tolts  to  check  access  to >sc1>opr_query_data,
      >sc1>cdt, >sc1>rcp>tandd.acs,  >sl1>phcs_, and >sl1>tandd_.
      If  the  user  lacks  access, tolts  will  return  an error
      message and wrap-up

      Modified  isolts to  accept the  -type control  argument to
      display_error at request level.


_P_r_o_b_e

      (10.0)  Installed  probe  version 5.4,  which  includes the
      following changes.

a- 1. (10.0)  Changed  the  probe  position and  use  requests to
      accept a qedx regular  expression surrounded by slashes (/)
      as an  alternative to the quoted  string argument.  Changed
      the  before  and after  requests  to accept  both  the qedx
      regular expression  and quoted string and  to set breaks at
      all matches.

a- 2. (10.0)  Added the  object request  to probe  to display the
      assembly instructions comprising the current source line or
      a   specified  number   of  source   lines.   The  assembly
      instructions are displayed in a format similar to that used
      by debug.

a- 3. (10.0) Changed the args request in probe to take an integer
      argument  specifying the  frame number  to use  rather than
      defaulting to  the current frame,  and to take  a procedure
      name and use the last  frame for that procedure.  Added the
      long name arguments to the args request.

a- 4. (10.0)      Added      the      -handle_conditions      and
      -no_handle_conditions   control  arguments   to  the  probe
      command.   These  control  arguments   allow  the  user  to
      determine whether probe handles all conditions and displays
      an appropriate message or allows faults.

a- 5. (10.0)  Added  the handlers  request to  probe to  list the
      condition  handlers  active  in  the  current  frame  or  a
      specified frame.

a- 6. (10.0) Added the "ptr unaligned"  type to the probe declare
      request to allow the user to declare packed pointers.

a- 7. (10.2) Changed probe  to use the probe search  list to find
      source  segments,  and  to  print arrays  and  strings with
      compression of similar array elements of substrings.

b- 1. (10.0)   Moved   all   >ldd>include_2   include   files  to
      >ldd>include to provide an easier and more efficient search
      method,  and  changed  the  system  default  for translator
      search paths accordingly.

      NOTE:   Users  are  advised to  remove  >ldd>include_2 from
      their  translator  search  paths.  The  system  default for
      translator search paths has been changed accordingly.

b- 2. (10.0) Added the peruse_crossref (pcref) command to examine
      the output  from the cross_reference  command.  By default,
      peruse_crossref  references cross_reference  output for the
      Multics  system.    This  output  is   distributed  in  the
      >ldd>crossref directory.

b- 3. (10.0)  Changed  the output  format of  the cross_reference
      command  to  include the  language suffixes  of referencing
      modules as an aid in locating them.

b- 4. (10.0) Changed the default action of the dump_vtoce command
      to brief.  The output consists of interpreted contents of a
      VTOCE.  The -long control argument  must be used when octal
      output is desired.

b- 5. (10.0)  Changed the  print_configuration_deck (pcd) command
      to interpret a binary -1 as a proper time zone offset value
      in CLOK card rather than as a null field.  The capabilities
      of  the  pcd command  are expanded  significantly, allowing
      more  flexibility  in selection  of configuration  cards to
      display.  Refer to the  System Programming Tools (Order No.
      AZ03) for details of the new features.

b- 6. (10.0) Installed  compare_configuration_deck as a  tool for
      maintenance of configuration files.

b- 7. (10.0)  Changed  the copy_dump_tape  command to  allow user
      specified  names  for  a  dump map.   Naming  dump  maps is
      allowed  by  new  functionality  of  the  -map  and -select
      control arguments.   The default naming is  a unique string
      with the suffix .map.

b- 8. (10.0) Changed the get_library_segment command to no longer
      search >ldd>auth_maint by default.   Sites that have a need
      for such  a directory should  not delete the  links in >ldd
      for auth_maint.control and should retain the control files.
      Sites    that    do    not   have    a    directory   named
      >documentation>iml_info_segments  are encouraged  to create
      the directory  and use it for  site specific info segments.
      The  existance of  this directory is  known by  many of the
      standard library commands.

b- 9. (10.0) Added the -page_offset  (-pgofs) control argument to
      the  print_bind_map command  to display the  page number of
      the first word of the text  section of each component as an
      octal number.   If the component crosses  at least one page
      boundary a plus (+) character follows the page number.

b-10. (10.0) Added  the signal command  (replaces signal_$signal)
      to  allow the  user to  test signalling  of conditions from
      command  level.   This   command  provides  improved  error
      detection and its control arguments specify information for
      the condition_info_ header.

b-11. (10.0)  Replaced the  dump_cdt command  with display_cdt to
      display information in the CDT.

b-12. (10.0)  Changed  the tape_ibm_  subroutine to  increase the
      maximum legal block size from 8192 to 32760 bytes, which is
      the  maximum  specified  in  the  IBM  tape  standard.  The
      default block size remains  8192.  No special permission is
      required to use  large block sizes up to  12288 bytes.  For
      blocks    larger    than    12288    bytes,    access    to
      >sc1>rcp>workspace.acs or the rcp_sys_ gate is required.

      Changed  the  tape_ibm_  subroutine to  accept  IBM encoded
      density  in  the HDR2  record which  are blank  or invalid,
      rather  than aborting  with an error  message.  The current
      density setting is used  instead.  The tape_ibm_ subroutine
      still encodes this field correctly on output.

b-13. (10.1) Changed  incompatibly the format of  the MST header.
      To make a system tape using the new header you MUST use the
      new generate_mst command.  The new generator can be used to
      generate tapes for preceeding  releases of both Multics and
      BOS.

b-14. (10.1) Enhanced the check_mst  command to detect and report
      overflows  of the  hardcore linkage  segments, definitions,
      and  name table.   The enhanced  check_mst command  MUST be
      used  to  check tapes  prepared  with the  new generate_mst
      command and  may NOT be  used to check  tapes prepared with
      previous releases.   The enhanced check_mst  displays error
      messages  on  error_output  and sets  a  severity indicator
      (accessed  by the  severity active  function).  Removed the
      addname  ckm   from  the  check_mst   tool.   The  enhanced
      check_mst can only be used  to check tapes generated by the
      enhanced generate_mst command.  To check tapes generated in
      earlier releases use the >obs>check_mst command.

b-15. (10.1)  Deleted the  merge_mst command.   All Multics tapes
      should be made with the generate_mst command.

b-16. (10.1) Recompiled  all programs in the  system libraries to
      correct  errors  diagnosed  by  the  most  recent  compiler
      version and to update listings.

b-17. (10.1) Changed the list_vols command to display:

     ox    percentage used figures for records and VTOCEs
     ox    average segment size per PV
     ox    an  X  flag  to  indicate  PVs  inhibited  for  segment
          creation
     ox    Records/VTOCEs used via a -rec_used control arg
     ox    output information within eighty columns
     ox    and additionally,  to allow processing  of multiple LVs
          via the -lv control argument,  and not print the P flag
          indicating partitions.

b-18. (10.1)      Added      the      get_system_aim_attributes_,
      compute_common_aim_ceiling_,  and translate_aim_attributes_
      subroutines  to  support  subsystems in  conversion  of AIM
      attributes between two Multics systems.

b-19. (10.1)  Replaced  the  add_copyright  and copyright_archive
      commands   with  the   new  add_pnotice,  generate_pnotice,
      list_pnotice_names, and display_pnotice commands to provide
      compliance  with  new software  protection  rules.  Deleted
      >tools>bound_copyright_  which contained  the add_copyright
      command,     copyright_archive     command,     and     the
      copyright_notice_ subroutine.

b-20. (10.1)  Installed   the  describe_psp  command   to  return
      information   about   products  based   on   the  marketing
      identifier.

b-21. (10.1) Installed the mvt_ subroutine to allow for efficient
      translation  of  character strings  using  translations not
      known at compile time.



Contents of MR10.2            3-33                        SRB10.2


b-22. (10.1)  Installed  the new  describe_psp command  to return
      information   about   products  based   on   the  marketing
      identifier.

b-23. (10.1) Replaced the system active function key words:

           _O_l_d _K_e_y                  _N_e_w _K_e_y
           date_up                  date_time_last_up
           down_until_date          date_time_next_up
           down_until_time          date_time_next_up
           last_down_date           date_time_last_down
           last_down_time           date_time_last_down
           next_down_date           date_time_next_down
           next_down_time           date_time_next_down
           shift_change_date        date_time_shift_change
           shift_change_time        date_time_shift_change
           time_up                  date_time_last_up

      It will be necessary to  combine the system active function
      with the substr active function  to simulate the old system
      return information.   The old key words  have been retained
      for compatibility.

b-24. (10.2)  Version  2  multi-segment  tables  (MSTBs)  are now
      supported.   In addition  to the capabilities  of Version 1
      MSTBs,  a Version  2 MSTB  provides for  the efficient case
      insensitive search of the  table.  The display_mstb command
      now   reports  the   version  number   of  an   MSTB.   The
      salvage_mstb command automatically converts Version 1 MSTBs
      to  Version  2.  As  Version  1 MSTBs  will continue  to be
      supported  for  the  forseeable future,  conversion  of the
      existing system MSTBs, the PNT  and URF, is not required in
      this release.

b-25. (10.2)  Deleted  the  compare_dump_tape_status  command and
      enhanced the copy_dump_tape  and compare_dump_tape commands
      functionality  to allow  for this  deletion.  Specifically,
      copy_dump_tape  and  compare_dump_tape now  set  a severity
      variable  which  can be  used to  determine the  success or
      failure of  a copy operation.  This  variable can be tested
      by using the severity active function.

b-26. (10.2)  Changed  (incompatibly)  Version  2  exec_com  &set
      statement to  strip quotes from its  arguments, the way the
      command  processor does,  making an  &set line  work like a
      value_set command line.

b-27. (10.2)   Changed   the    reduction_compiler   command   to
      automatically   invoke  the   PL/I  compiler   following  a
      successful translation by rdc.   Added several new features
      including:    -trace   control   argument   for   debugging
      reductions;  and setting  of a severity  variable which the
      severity  active  function can  reference to  determine the
      success of the compilation.

b-28. (10.2)  Deleted the  subsystem_utils_ subroutine.  Programs
      which  used the  subsystem_utils_ must now  be converted to
      use  the  new ssu_  utilities  which are  described  in the
      Programmer's  Reference  Manual, Order  No.  AG91,  and the
      Subroutines and I/O Modules, Order No.  AG93.

b-29. (10.2) Changed the io_call command to accept the open_file,
      close_file,  and detach  requests to  support the  new iox_
      entries.   Complete  documentation on  this command  can be
      found in  the Multics Commands and  Active Functions, Order
      No.  AG92.

b-30. (10.2)  Added  mrl_  and  mlr_  subroutines  which  provide
      efficient access  to the respective  hardware instructions.
      These subroutines are documented in the Multics Subroutines
      and I/O Modules, Order No.  AG93.

b-31. (10.2)  Enhanced  the  display_subsystem_usage  command  by
      adding  the -version  control argument  and a  version sort
      type, allowing  the use of -totals  with -user or -version,
      allowing the use of -first N  with -user, and by making the
      totals  printed  when selecting  a  subset of  entries (via
      -user or -version) reflect only the selected entries.

b-32. (10.2)   Added  the   initiate_file_$create  entrypoint  to
      initiate  a  segment or  create it  if necessary.   Added a
      DELETE bit to the  terminate_file_ action argument clean up
      after a call to initiate_file_$create.

b-33. (10.2)  Changed the  dump_vtoce tool  to accept  a pathname
      argument that no longer  requires the use of display_branch
      when only a pathname is known.

b-34. (10.2)  Added  the -public_domain  control argument  to the
      add_pnotice  command  to provide  a public  domain software
      protection notice.

b-35. (10.2)  Added   the  -pathname  control   argument  to  the
      print_configuration_deck command to  allow specification of
      the  config deck  to be  displayed.  By  default (as  it is
      now),  the  print_configuration_deck  command  displays the
      live deck.

b-36. (10.2) Added io_call support  for window_io_ control orders
      and   new  keywords   to  the   window_call  command.   The
      supported_terminal  keyword  returns  "true"  if  the video
      system can  be invoked on  the specified terminal  type and
      the  video_invoked  keyword  returns  "true"  if  the video
      system  is   invoked  in  the  user's   process.   The  new
      window_io_   control    orders   are   get/set_more_prompt,
      get/set_more_handler,                get/set_more_response,
      get/set_token_characters,            get/set_window_status,
      get/set_editing_chars, and set_editor_key_bindings.  (Refer
      to  Multics Menu  Creation Facilities, Order  No.  CP51, or
      Multics Subroutines and I/O Modules, Order No.  AG93.

      Extended  the video  system input-line-editor  to provide a
      facility  for setting  editor key  bindings.  Any keystroke
      sequence may  be set to  invoke any of  the internal editor
      routines (such as forward-word)  as well as editor routines
      written  by the  user.  (For detailed  information, see the
      description  of the  set_editor_key_bindings control order,
      for the  window_io_ I/O module, in  Multics Subroutines and
      I/O Modules, Order No.  AG93.)

      Changed handling of raw output  in the video system so that
      calls  to   window_$write_raw_text  no  longer   result  in
      spurious   cursor   position   operations.    However,  the
      screen_invalid   status   flag  is   set   by  a   call  to
      write_raw_text, and must be reset by the application before
      any further  video operations can be  performed.  (For more
      information, see the description  of the window_ subroutine
      in Multics Subroutines and I/O Modules, Order No.  AG93.)

b-37. (10.2)  Added a  subroutine interface  to the  qedx editor.
      (Refer to the qedx_ description in the Subroutines manual.)

c- 1. (10.0)  Changed the  tape_ansi_ subroutine  to increase the
      maximum  legal block  size from  8192 to  99996 bytes.  The
      default  block size  remains 2048  bytes.  Note  that block
      sizes  larger  than  2048  bytes, while  valid  on Multics,
      violate the  ANSI tape standard.  No  special permission is
      required to use larger block  sizes up to 12288 bytes.  For
      blocks   larger   than   12288   bytes,   access   to   the
      >sc1>rcp>workspace.acs  or the  rcp_sys_ gate  is required.
      The tape_ansi_ subroutine conforms to ANSI X3.27-1978 Level
      1, entitled American National Standard Magnetic Tape Labels
      and File Structure for Information Interchange.  It thereby
      complies with  the Federal Information  Processing Standard
      79 (FIPS).

c- 2. (10.0)  Changed  RCP  to  allow specification  of  the tape
      handler speed (in  inches per second).  This is  done via a
      -speed control argument in  the assign_resource command, or
      -speed control argument in the resource_description for the
      reserve_resource command.

c- 3. (10.0)  Changed  the  tape_in  and  tape_out  commands:  to
      implement  the  documented   but  previously  unimplemented
      features of the "-ring"  control argument; to recognize the
      new maximum  block sizes for tape_ibm_  and tape_ansi_; and
      to support 6250 BPI tapes.   Also fixed all known errors in
      these commands.

c- 4. (10.0) Changed the read_tape_and_query  command to accept a
      "-comment" control argument to  specify a string display on
      the operator's console with the mount request.

c- 5. (10.0) Changed the tape_archive tape volume query to accept
      32   character  volumes   rather  than   only  8.   Changed
      load_table to accept the -density control argument.

c- 6. (10.1)  Installed  tape_ioi_ (a  new  tape interface)  as a
      replacement  for  the undocumented  tdcm_  interface.  User
      programs using  tdcm_ should be converted  to tape_ioi_ due
      to   the  improved   functionality,  error   recovery,  and
      performance.   The  tdcm_  interfaces will  continue  to be
      supported  for  the  immediate  future.   Of  the  tape I/O
      modules supplied  with the system, only  the tape_mult_ I/O
      module has been converted to  use tape_ioi_.  The other I/O
      modules will be converted in a future release.

c- 7. (10.1) Moved the ntape_ I/O module to the obsolete library.
      Sites should use tape_nstd_.

c- 8. (10.1) Increased  the maximum IOI workspace  size from 3072
      words to 6144 words when processing tapes for users lacking
      access to workspace.acs.

c- 9. (10.2)  Several  new  features  and  bug  fixes  have  been
      included  in  tape_archive  version 4.   Added  an optional
      -alternate argument to the  'alter table density N' request
      to permit  independent management of  volume set densities.
      Mixed tape drive configurations  are supported by including
      the  -density  argument  on  all  mount  requests.  Default
      density references have been centralized to an include file
      constant.   The  xd and  xdf  requests are  supported  in a
      similar  manner  to archive.   Specifying  -long for  the t
      request on an empty  tape produces long header information.
      Additional checks  have been added  to prevent tape_archive
      from inadvertently deleting the  table currently being used
      for processing.

      Because  of the  current action  of ANSI  and IBM  tape I/O
      modules  when  -density  is  omitted  (i.e.,  honoring  the
      current density  of the VOL1  label), it is  possible for a
      tape_archive  volume  set  to  actually  be  recorded  at a
      density different  than that specified in  the table.  With
      version 4 the recording density in the table must match the
      volume  set  density.  Any  discrepancies may  be rectified
      using the 'alter table density N' request.

      In fact, altering the density of the primary volume set for
      a non-empty table is permitted with a warning only to bring
      the density  entered in the  table in line  with the actual
      recording density of the  volume set.  Automatic compaction
      of a volume  set is scheduled only when  the density of the
      alternate volume set is changed.

d- 1. (10.0)  Changed  the check_info_segs  command to  store the
      date/time  it  last  checked  info segments  in  the user's
      default  value segment  rather than in  the profile segment
      used  by  the  abbrev command.   The  command automatically
      copies the  date/time from the user's  profile segment into
      the  default  value  segment  the  first  time  it  is used
      following the installation of this release.

d- 2. (10.0)  Changed   the  print_motd  command   to  store  the
      information required to determine changes to the message of
      the day in the user's  default value segment rather than in
      a segment named Person_id.motd  in the home directory.  The
      command  automatically  copies  the  information  from  the
      Person_id.motd  segment and  then deletes  that segment the
      first time it is used after the installation of MR10.0.

d- 3. (10.0) Changed the -all  control argument to the value_list
      command   to   list   the   names  of   variables   set  by
      value_$set_data  in   addition  to  the   values  currently
      displayed.  Added  the -data control argument  to list only
      the data variables.

d- 4. (10.2) Added  the -data and  -all control arguments  to the
      value_delete    command   to    delete   values    set   by
      value_$set_data.

      Added  the  -brief  control  argument  to  the value_delete
      command  to  suppress  the  error  message  "No  match  for
      starname...".

      Added   the   -pop  control   argument  to   the  value_get
      command/active function to allow the user to pop and return
      a value.

e- 1. (10.0)  Installed the  dial_out command  to allow  users to
      access  a  remote  system  through  autocall  channels  (as
      defined in the CDT).  The  command is documented in the MPM
      Communications I/O Manual (Order No.  CC92).

e- 2. (10.0) Added  new commands to  make it easier  for users to
      enter   output   (dprint    or   dpunch)   requests.    The
      enter_output_request  (eor)  command  allows  nonpositional
      control arguments,  supports star convention,  and lets the
      user define default control  argument settings for the many
      output-related  control  arguments.   User-defined defaults
      are  specified  by  allowing  the user  to  define  his own
      request types.  This command  replaces the functionality of
      the dprint and dpunch commands.  However, dprint and dpunch
      are retained for compatibility.

      Added  several  new  commands to  support  the user-defined
      request      types     of      eor.      These     include:
      cancel_output_request  (cor),  list_output_requests  (lor),
      move_output_request (mor)  and total_output_requests (tor).
      Also  updated  the  print_request_types  (prt)  command  to
      support user-defined request types and to work as an active
      function.   Refer  to MPM  Commands  (Order No.   AG92) for
      further details.

e- 3. (10.0)  Changed  the  Video  System to  allow  the  user to
      control  MORE  handling.  In  addition some  serious errors
      were  fixed, such  as:  an  asynchronous output  error that
      causes process termination; an  error that causes long line
      truncation; and a serious  looping error that significantly
      impacts performance.

e- 4. (10.0) Changed  initiate_file_ and initiate_file_$component
      entrypoints to return  a zero error code when  a segment or
      component to be initiated has a zero bit count.

e- 5. (10.0) Added the cv_error_$name subroutine which, given the
      name of an error table  entry point, returns the error code
      associated with that name.

e- 6. (10.1)  Added the  -defer_until_process_termination control
      argument to  the dprint and  enter_output_request commands.
      Use of  this argument defers  dprinting the file  (e.g., an
      absentee output file) until  the process terminates or logs
      out.

e- 7. (10.1)      Changed       the      list_retrieval_requests,
      list_daemon_requests, and  list_output_requests commands to
      search all queues by default.

e- 8. (10.1) Enhanced  the video system line  editor to include a
      subset  of Emacs  editing requests.   The requests provided
      are:

     ox    forward character (^F)
     ox    backward character (^B)
     ox    delete character (^D)
     ox    rubout character (DEL or #)
     ox    forward word (ESC F)
     ox    backward word (ESC B)
     ox    delete word (ESC D)
     ox    rubout word (ESC DEL or ESC #)
     ox    go to beginning of line (@)
     ox    kill to end of line (^K)
     ox    yank last kill (^Y)
     ox    yank previous item in kill ring (ESC Y)
     ox    clear window and redisplay line (^L)
     ox    quote next character (^Q)
     ox    twiddle characters (^T)

e- 9. (10.1)  Changed  the  sort_seg  command  to  provide better
      protection from accidental sorting of segments.  If neither
      the  -replace  nor  -segment control  arguments  are given,
      sort_seg asks if the user really wants to replace the input
      segment with  a sorted version.   This may cause  some user
      exec_coms to ask questions that had not been asked in prior
      releases.   The  question  may  be  avoided  by  using  the
      -replace  control argument  to explicitly  request that the
      input segment be replaced by its sorted contents.

      Changed  the sort_seg  command by  adding new  features for
      specifying sort fields.  Refer  to the Multics Commands and
      Active Functions Manual, Order No.  AG92, for details.

e-10. (10.1) Installed the sort_seg_  subroutine to provide entry
      points  for sorting  segments and  character strings.  This
      subroutine  interface is  used by the  sort_seg command and
      provides  all  of  the  facilities of  the  command  at the
      subroutine level.

e-11. (10.1)  Updated  the buffer  manipulation strategy  used by
      qedx  to  make  better  use of  segments  and significantly
      reduced the number of modified pages in disk queues.

e-12. (10.1)  Added the  Q request  to qedx  as a  synonym to the
      existing   quit   request.   The   quit  request   will  be
      incompatibly changed in the  next release, MR10.2, to query
      the  user  if  a modified  buffer  exists at  the  time the
      request  is   issued.   Any  exec_coms   required  to  quit
      unconditionally from qedx invocations  should be changed to
      use the Q request.

e-13. (10.1) Added the timed_io_ subroutine to allow a program to
      regain  control when  an IO  operation takes  longer than a
      specified amount  of time.  Entrypoints  are provided which
      are   equivalent  to   iox_$get_chars,  iox_$get_line,  and
      iox_$put_chars.   For IO  operations utilizing  the tty_ IO
      module  timed_io_ uses  three new  control orders  in tty_:
      get_chars_timeout, put_chars_timeout, and get_line_timeout.

e-14. (10.1) Installed  the compare_pl1.ec to  compare the source
      of two PL/1 programs ignoring most formatting differences.

e-15. (10.1)  Added  the  validate_processid  entry  to  hcs_  to
      validate that a process identifier corresponds to a process
      which exists.

e-16. (10.1) Added the xd key to the archive command to extract a
      component into a segment and then delete the component from
      the archive.

e-17. (10.1) Changed the create_dir command to set directory ring
      brackets to 7,7 by default.   The default can be overridden
      by   using   the  -ring_brackets   control   argument  with
      create_dir.

e-18. (10.1) Changed the create, create_dir, and link commands to
      no  longer  accept  names  beginning with  dashes  or blank
      names.










Contents of MR10.2            3-41                        SRB10.2


e-19. (10.1)  Added the  -chase, -check,  and -copy_names control
      arguments to the link command.  The -chase control argument
      causes the created link to  point to the ultimate target of
      the  specified  target path.   The -check  control argument
      causes link to abort if  the specified link target does not
      exist or if its existence cannot be determined because of a
      lack  of access.   The -copy_names  control argument copies
      the link target's names to the created link.

e-20. (10.1)  Changed the  abbrev command  and standard subsystem
      request to  work as an  active function or  active request.
      As  an  active function  abbrev returns  the value  true or
      false.  This response  indicates abbreviation processing is
      enabled  or  disabled  at   command  level  or  within  the
      subsystem.

e-21. (10.1)  Changed  the  name  of  the  supervisor  gate  from
      xhcs_$get_stack_ptr   to    hcs_$set_stack_ptr.    Programs
      calling  xhcs_$get_stack_ptr  should  be  updated  to  call
      hcs_$get_stack_ptr.  For  compatibility the name  xhcs_ has
      been added  to hcs_.  The  xhcs_ name will be  removed in a
      future release.

e-22. (10.1) Added the -output_file (-of) control argument to the
      compare_ascii command to direct  the output of a comparison
      to a user specified file.

e-23. (10.1)  Provided  a set  of standard  functions for  use by
      application  writers  in developing  their  own subsystems.
      Use of  ssu_ functions will enable  the application builder
      to provide subsystems which are consistent in terms of user
      interface and system response.

e-24. (10.1)  Changed  get_quota to  allow its  use as  an active
      funtion.   When  used  as  an  active  function  it returns
      terminal   quota   on  a   single  directory.    Added  the
      -records_left, -quota, and  -records_used control arguments
      for   either  command   or  active   function  usage.   The
      -records_left  control  argument   returns  the  number  of
      available pages in a directory, -quota returns the terminal
      quota  on  each  directory, and  -records_used  returns the
      number of pages used in each directory.

e-25. (10.1)  Added  the  -all,  -brief,  -chase,  and  -no_chase
      control  arguments  to the  mbx_set_acl  and mbx_delete_acl
      commands.   The  -all  control  argument  deletes  all  ACL
      entries except *.SysDaemon.*.   The -brief control argument
      suppresses  the  "User name  not  on ACL"  and  "Empty ACL"
      messages.   The  -chase  control  argument,  default value,
      chases  linked  mailboxes  while  -no_chase  suppresses the
      chasing of links when using the star convention.

e-26. (10.1)  Added  the  -brief, -chase,  and  -no_chase control
      arguments    to   the    mbx_list_acl   command.    Changed
      mbx_list_acl  to  be  callable  as an  active  function and
      return the modes and access names of matching entries.

e-27. (10.1)  Changed the  default value for  the -target control
      argument to l68 for compiling ALM programs.

e-28. (10.1)  Installed   the  have_queue_entries  command/active
      function to  return true if  there are messages  in a queue
      message segment and false if there are no messages.

e-29. (10.1) Changed the who command to no longer list daemons by
      default.   The  -daemon control  argument  MUST be  used to
      display daemon processes.  Added  the -all control argument
      to list daemon, absentee, and interactive users.

e-30. (10.2) Installed  the where_doc, explain_doc,  and tutorial
      commands.   The  explain_doc  command  returns  information
      about  a manual  specified by  manual name,  short name, or
      order  number.  The  where_doc command returns  the name of
      the  manual(s) that  contain information  about a specified
      topic_name   where   topic_name   is   a   topic,  command,
      subroutine,  or I/O  module.  The  tutorial command invokes
      the Multics Tutorial, a menu-driven introduction to Multics
      that may be used to learn the basic features of the Multics
      system.

e-31. (10.2)  Added the  -brief, -no_start_up,  -8bit, and -modes
      control arguments to the dial_out command.  Added new modes
      send_if,  echo_if, and  quit.  Replaced the  -raw and -line
      control arguments with a raw and ^raw mode where raw is the
      default.  Changed  dial_out to provide  a CR when  the user
      types a CR, even in lfecho mode.

e-32. (10.2)  Added  the wait  request  to dial_out  to  ease the
      creation of dial_out exec_coms.

      Added the  connect command to simplify  the connection to a
      foreign system by a user.

e-33. (10.2)  Enhanced   support  of  generic   destinations  for
      dial_out   by   providing  the   ability  to   dial_out  or
      priv_attach a channel given a generic destination specifier
      such as tymnet, modem, protocol_converter_box, etc.

e-34. (10.2) Changed the system command/active function and added
      the system_info_$version_id subroutine  entry to supply the
      version_id    obtained    from    the    MULT    tape   via
      active_all_rings_data.

e-35. (10.2) Changed the  assign_resource command to additionally
      perform  as  an active  function.   It returns  true  if an
      assignment  is successful  and false  otherwise.  The -long
      control  argument is  not allowed  in the  active function.
      The list_resources  command can be used  to obtain the name
      of the assigned devices.

e-36. (10.2)  The qedx  command can  now be  invoked recursively.
      When this is done, qedx informs the user and asks if he/she
      wishes  to  continue.   Answering  this  query  with  a "?"
      causes qedx  to display an explanation  of the implications
      of recursive invocations.

e-37. (10.2)  The  qedx  editor  now  accepts  archive  component
      pathnames, in  the initial macro pathname,  as the argument
      to the  -pathname control argument,  and as an  argument to
      the  read  request.   Attempts   to  write  to  an  archive
      component,  however, produce  the standard  "This procedure
      may not modify archive components."  error message.

e-38. (10.2) Changed the qedx editor to implement trusted default
      pathnames   like   those   implemented   within   ted.   In
      particular,  any attempt  to read  a file  into a non-empty
      buffer, or write only part of a buffer to a file, no longer
      causes qedx to forget  the default pathname associated with
      the   buffer.    Instead,   the  pathname   is   marked  as
      untrustworthy and the next attempt to read or write without
      an explicit  pathname causes qedx to  ask for permission to
      use the default pathname.

e-39. (10.2) The subroutine interface  to the Multics Mail System
      has been installed.

      Converted  all  of  the  standard  Multics  mail processing
      subsystems     --     the     Extended     Mail    Facility
      (print_mail/read_mail/send_mail),   the    Executive   Mail
      Facility, and the  Emacs mail subsystem -- to  use this new
      interface.   However,  the  mail  command,  the  send_mail_
      subroutine,   and   the    interactive   message   facility
      (accept_messages/send_message) have not yet been converted.

      Extended the Multics Mail System to support three new types
      of addressses:  mailing lists,  forum meetings, and entries
      in   a  system-wide   Mail  Table.    The  mail  processing
      subsystems  listed  above automatically  support  these new
      address types due to their conversion to the new interface.

      A  mailing list  is an  ASCII segment  or archive component
      which  contains  one or  more  addresses.  Mail  sent  to a
      mailing list is delivered to all the addresses specified in
      the segment or archive component.

      The Mail Table provides the ability  to send mail to a user
      without  having  to  know  on which  projects  the  user is
      registered.  Users are allowed  to update their own entries
      in the table.  The mail  table also provides the ability to
      define  system-wide names  for mailing lists  or other mail
      system addresses.

      For more information on these facilities, type:

                help mail_system.gi
                help message_format.gi
                help mail_addresses.gi
                help mail_table.gi
                help mailing_lists.gi

e-40. (10.2)  Added  the  cv_links_to_mail_table  command  to aid
      those  sites which  have been  making use  of the Mailboxes
      link directory.  This command  tool attempts to incorporate
      the   information   from   the   mailbox   links  directory
      (>udd>Daemon>mailboxes) into the  Mail Table, prompting the
      user (who must have access  to mail_table_priv_) when it is
      unsure of a mapping (generally due to case differences).

e-41. (10.2) Defined a canonical form for mail system messages to
      allow   a   more   efficient   search   by   read_mail  and
      executive_mail.   For  information on  this  message format
      type:

                help message_format.gi -section canonical form

      Mailboxes  containing  many   pre-MR10.2  messages  can  be
      canonicalized  by  using the  canonicalize_mailbox command;
      users   are  cautioned   to  read  the   Notes  section  of
      message_format.gi.info or description  provided in Commands
      and Active  Functions, Order No.  AG92,  prior to using the
      canonicalize_mailbox command, as  it has side-effects which
      may be undesirable.   A canonicalize_mailbox.ec is provided
      for  system  administrators  who wish  to  canonicalize all
      saveboxes in a subtree;  see the Installation Instructions,
      Section 4, for more information on this.

e-42. (10.2)       Added        the       mailbox_$compact_index,
      mailbox_$compact_file,  message_segment_$compact_index, and
      message_segment_$compact_file  ring-1   primitives  to  the
      system.  These primitives provide the capability to compact
      mailboxes  and  message segments,  thus  eliminating unused
      space.       Modified      the      mailbox_$close      and
      message_segment_$close primitives  to automatically request
      a  compaction  of  the  mailbox or  message  segment  if it
      contains more than 25% unused space.

e-43. (10.2)  Added  the mailbox_$copy  and message_segment_$copy
      ring-1 primitives  to the system to  provide the capability
      to copy mailboxes and message segments respectively.

e-44. (10.2)  Added  the -output_switch  control argument  to the
      print command to allow the output  to be directed to an I/O
      switch  other  than user_output.   Added the  -last control
      argument to select the last N lines of a file for printing.

e-45. (10.2)  Added  16  control arguments  to  the archive_table
      command to allow a user to obtain information without using
      the  file_output command.   The new  control arguments are:
      -absolute_pathname,       -bit_count,      -component_name,
      -date_time_contents_modified,  -date_time_updated, -header,
      -mode,        -name,        -requote,        -no_bit_count,
      -no_date_time_contents_modified,     -no_date_time_updated,
      -no_header,  -no_mode,  -no_name,  and  -no_requote.  (Type
      "help  act"  for  more  detail,  or  refer  to  the command
      description in Multics Commands and Active Functions, Order
      No.  AG92.

e-46. (10.2)  Added  the  shortest_path  command/active function.
      This command has  the same syntax and function  as the path
      command/active function except that calls use the result of
      get_shortest_path_  on  the target  pathname as  the return
      value.

e-47. (10.2) Changed  the move command to  preserve the following
      attributes  of  a  segment  or MSF:   complete  volume dump
      switch,  copy switch,  incremental volume  dump switch, max
      length,  ring  brackets,  and  safety  switch.   When  ring
      brackets  cannot   be  maintained  a   warning  message  is
      displayed.

e-48. (10.2) Added  the -time_zone control argument  to the time,
      date_time,  and the  other date_time  commands that display
      date  and  time.   The  -time_zone  argument  converts  the
      displayed time to a specified time zone.

_A_P_L

      (10.2) Installed  APL Version 5.02 to  fix bugs and provide
      several new features.

f- 1. Changed  APL  to use  apl search  paths to  locate external
      functions and workspaces to be loaded.

f- 2. Added  the qCALL  function to  allow invocation  of pl1 and
      fortran programs.  This function  allows a more generalized
      parameter list than previously provided.

f- 3. Added an apl_coded_ subroutine  interface to provide stream
      type I/O for the APL environment.


_C_O_B_O_L

      (10.2) Installed  Version 5.3 of the  COBOL compiler to fix
      numerous bugs.


_E_M_A_C_S

      (10.0) Installed Emacs version 11.11 which includes several
      new features.

h- 1. (10.0)  Adds a  new prefix  ^\ (undo-prefix).   This prefix
      sets the variable "undo" to  t, informing the next function
      called to  attempt to do  the reverse of  its usual action.
      Thus, typing ^\ ^X_  de-underlines the current region.  Use
      of this new prefix will be  extended to other requests in a
      future release.

h- 2. (10.0)   Adds   a  new   define-command   (defcom)  keyword
      "&undo-function" ("&undo").   This is used  to introduce an
      action for the undo prefix (^\) for a user-defined command.
      Refer  to  the Emacs  Extension  Writers' Guide  (Order No.
      CJ52) for further details.

h- 3. (10.0) Changed Emacs to  find the start_up.emacs segment by
      a simple heuristic, like  the start_up.ec heuristic.  If no
      start_up.emacs is found in the user's home directory, Emacs
      looks  in the  project directory  and then  in >site  for a
      start_up.emacs segment.

h- 4. (10.0)   Added   new  options,   including:   command-bell,
      command-bell-count,    and   meter-commands.     For   more
      information, type:  help emacs.changes

      (10.1) Installed Emacs version 12.0b which includes several
      minor enhancements.

h- 5. (10.2)  Upgraded  Emacs RMAIL  to use  the new  MR10.2 mail
      system   primitives.   This   has  implicitly   fixed  many
      problems,  most  notably all  of  the RMAIL  header parsing
      deficiencies.  It  also allows RMAIL users  to send mail to
      mailing lists, forum meetings, and mail table addresses.

      When  determining  the  sender's return  address,  RMAIL no
      longer          makes          use          of          the
      emacs-site-dir>rmail-full-name-table         or         the
      "my-personal-name"  variable.   Instead   the  mail  system
      obtains   the   user's   real    name   from   either   the
      Person_id.full_name._  or  full_name._   variables  in  the
      user's default value segment.

h- 6. (10.2) SPECIAL  NOTICE:  In a  future release of  Emacs the
      read-file command (^X^R) will be  changed to query the user
      for permission to read the  file if the buffer is modified.
      This  query  will be  skipped  is ^X^R  is given  a numeric
      argument  (e.g.,  ^U^X^R).  This  change may  affect users'
      saved  keyboard  macros.   Users  who rely  on  the current
      behavior in keyboard macros should change them now to use a
      supplied numeric argument.  A  supplied numeric argument is
      currently ignored,  however making the change  at this time
      will  significantly reduce  the impact  of the incompatible
      change.  This  change should not  affect extensions written
      in Lisp  since those extensions should  not be calling this
      function.

_E_x_e_c_u_t_i_v_e _M_a_i_l

      (10.0) Installed Executive Mail  version 1.5.  This version
      corrects several problems found in prior releases.

i- 1. (10.0) Note:   In order to  use the Multics  Executive Mail
      Facility, the user's terminal type must:

     ox    be  defined with  a video  table entry  in the Terminal
          Type File (TTF).

     ox    be defined with a function key table in the TTF, if the
          terminal has  function keys F1 through  F8 and the user
          wants to use these function keys with Executive Mail

      The TTF  is described in the  MPM Communications I/O manual
      (Order No.  CC92).

      (10.2) Installed Executive Mail version 2.0b.  This version
      corrects several problems found in prior releases.

i- 2. (10.2)     Changed     the     xmail     directory     from
      >udd>Project>Person>Person.xmail                         to
      >udd>Project>Person>Person.mlsys.   The  new name  is added
      when  the directory  exists.  When  the directory  does not
      exist a directory with the name Person.mlsys is created.

      Changed the xmail mailing list  suffix from .mlist to .mls.
      Addnames  with the  suffix .mls  are added  to all existing
      mailing lists  in the xmail directory.   Newly created ones
      use the new name.

      The  name changes  are required for  compatability with the
      new mail system.  All newly created links, ecs, and abbrevs
      should  use  the new  naming convensions.   Existing links,

j- 1. (10.1)  Incorporated numerous  enhancements to  the Multics
      Mail  System.    Several  of  the   enhancements  represent
      incompatible  changes  in  the  user  interface.   In these
      cases,  the  old  interface  will still  be  supported, but
      undocumented,  and  will be  removed  in a  future release.
      Complete  documentation  of  these  changes  are  available
      online and  in the Multics Mail  System User's Guide, Order
      No.  CH23.

j- 2. (10.1)  Converted the  read_mail and  send_mail commands to
      use the  new subsystem utilities made  available in MR10.0.
      This  conversion  provides numerous  enhancements  to these
      subsystems including:

     ox    abbreviation processing  of request lines  using either
          the  same  or a  different  profile from  that  used at
          Multics command level.

     ox    additional  standard  requests including  exec_com, do,
          if, answer, ready, ready_on, ready_off, subsystem_name,
          and subsystem_version.

     ox    improved self-documentation facilities  including a new
          definition of  the "?"  request,  the new list_requests
          and  list_help requests,  and an  improved help request
          including the capability to use "help -brief".


PRINT_MAIL


k- 1. (10.1) Added  short names, shown in  parenthesis, for three
      query responses;  yes (y), no (n),  and reprint (print, pr,
      p).

k- 2. (10.1)  Add the  -long, -no_list,  -own, -count, -no_count,
      -acknowledge, and -no_acknowledge  control arguments to the
      print_mail command.

k- 3. (10.1) Added a program_interrupt  handler to the print_mail
      command  to  repeat the  "Delete  this message?"   query to
      allow a user to interrupt the display of a long message and
      go directly  to the query  when the user  decides to delete
      the message.

k- 4. (10.1) Changed the print_mail  command to recognize the "?"
      response  and  display a  list  of valid  responses  to the
      "Delete this message?"  query.


READ_MAIL AND PRINT_MAIL


l- 1. (10.1)  Changed   (incompatibly)  the  way   read_mail  and
      print_mail interpret a noncontrol  argument used to specify
      the  mailbox on  the command  line.  The  argument is first
      interpreted as -mailbox  STR; if no mailbox is  found it is
      interpreted  as -save  STR; if  no savebox  is found  it is
      interpreted as -user STR.

l- 2. (10.1)  Changed  the  message  sent  when  acknowledging  a
      message in  read_mail or print_mail to  include the subject
      of the original message if present.

l- 3. (10.1)  Changed   read_mail  and  print_mail   to  issue  a
      reset_more control  order after displaying  each message to
      allow users of video systems to easily abort the display of
      a single message when displaying several messages.  This is
      an incompatible change from prior releases of read_mail.

l- 4. (10.2)  Changed  the  -no_header  control  argument  of the
      print_mail  command  and  the  read_mail  print  request to
      display no  information from the header.   Only the message
      number, line count, and  message body are displayed.  Added
      the -brief_header  control argument to  display the minimal
      amount  of information  from the  message header, including
      the  date,  author(s),  and  subject  of  the  message.  In
      addition,  an indication  of whether  the user  is the sole
      recipient  of  the  message  is  included  along  with  any
      comments added to the message  if it was forwarded by other
      users.


READ_MAIL

      (10.1) Installed read_mail version 8.3.

m- 1. (10.1)  Added  the  -count,  -no_count,  -acknowledge,  and
      -no_acknowledge control arguments to the read_mail command.

m- 2. (10.1)  Added  the  print_header  request  to  read_mail to
      display   the   complete  header   of  the   message.   The
      -header_only control argument,  used with previous releases
      to display the message header,  is now obsolete and will be
      deleted in a future release.

m- 3. (10.1) Added the apply request  to read_mail to function in
      a  fashion  similar  to  the  apply  request  in send_mail.
      However, in  this release, any changes  made to the message
      text  by  the  Multics  command  are  not  recorded  in the
      mailbox.

m- 4. (10.1) Added short names, shown in parenthesis, for several
      read_mail requests; current (c), delete (dl, d), first (f),
      forward (fwd, for), last (l), and print (pr, p).










Contents of MR10.2            3-51                        SRB10.2


m- 5. (10.1) Replaced the -all  control argument accepted by most
      read_mail     requests    with     the    -include_deleted,
      -only_deleted,  and  -only_non_deleted  control  arguments.
      The  -all control  argument was previously  used to specify
      that the request was to  act on both deleted and nondeleted
      messages and  is directly replaced  by the -include_deleted
      control argument.  The  -only_deleted and -only_non_deleted
      control  arguments  allow selection  of the  other possible
      groupings  with  respect  to  deleted  messages.   The -all
      control  argument  is  no  longer  documented  and  will be
      deleted in a future release.

m- 6. (10.1)  Added  new control  arguments  to the  list, print,
      print_header, delete, and retrieve requests in read_mail to
      allow  selection  of messages  by date,  author, recipient,
      and/or subject.

m- 7. (10.1)  Added the  -prompt STR,  -no_prompt, -include_self,
      and  -no_include_self   control  arguments  to   the  reply
      request.   The -no_include_self  default prevents  the user
      from receiving a copy of  the reply without taking specific
      action.  This  constitutes an incompatible  change with the
      previous release of read_mail.

m- 8. (10.1) Enhanced the read_mail reply request to:

     ox    list the recipients of a reply rather than stating only
          the number of recipients to receive the reply,

     ox    include the Date, From,  and Subject fields in addition
          to   the   original  text   in   the  reply   when  the
          -include_original control argument is specified,

     ox    create the send_mail used to compose the reply with the
          same  state of  abbreviation processing  and profile as
          the read_mail invocation in which the reply was given,

     ox    refuse  to  honor  the   -delete  control  argument  if
          send_mail is exited without sending the reply,

     ox    allow the -line_length N, -indent N, -include_self, and
          -no_include_self control  arguments to be  given on the
          read_mail  command line  to set default  values for any
          use  of   the  reply  request   within  that  read_mail
          invocation.

m- 9. (10.1) Changed  the read_mail command to  query the user if
      an attempt is  made to delete a message  which has not been
      listed,  printed,  saved, or  written.  The  -force control
      argument for the delete request may be used to suppress the
      query.   The  query is  an  incompatible change  from prior
      releases of read_mail.

      (10.2) Installed read_mail version 9.1e.

m-10. (10.2)  Added  the  -add_comments control  argument  to the
      read_mail forward request to  provide the capability to add
      a comment to  a message when it is  forwarded.  The user is
      prompted  for text  to be  used as  the forwarding comment.
      This  text may  be edited  as in  the reply  request and is
      placed in the header field named "Redistributed-Comment:".


SEND_MAIL

      (10.1) Installed send_mail version 6.0.

n- 1. (10.1) Changed (incompatibly) how send_mail fills a message
      to  make  send_mail  more  compatible  with  forum.   These
      changes include:

     ox    changed  the default  of terminal  input to  -fill, the
          default of file input is left unchanged as -no_fill.

     ox    filling,  if  enabled, takes  place after  exiting qedx
          during initial input rather  than before entering qedx.
          This  eliminates  the  previous  behavior  of send_mail
          where the user's qedx  editing request would often fail
          as  the message  in the  editor's buffer  was formatted
          differently from what was visible to the user.

     ox    filling, if enabled, occurs automatically following the
          execution  of  any qedx  or  apply request.   Added the
          -fill  and -no_fill  control arguments to  the qedx and
          apply  request to  allow the user  to control automatic
          filling.

n- 2. (10.1)  Changed  (incompatibly)   the  -input_file  control
      argument  in send_mail  to imply  the -request_loop control
      argument.

n- 3. (10.1)  Added several  new requests to  send_mail which are
      only available within a send_mail invocation created by the
      read_mail reply request.  The new  requests allow a user to
      examine  the  original  messages being  answered.   The new
      requests are print_original, list_original, save_originals,
      print_original_header, log_original, and write_original.




Contents of MR10.2            3-53                        SRB10.2


n- 4. (10.1) Added  short names, shown in  parenthesis, for three
      send_mail requests; append (app),  preface (prf), and print
      (pr, p).

      (10.2)  Installed  send_mail  version 8.0e  to  provide bug
      fixes and several new features.

n- 5. (10.2)  Changed the  send_mail command to  display an error
      message  and  return  to  command  level  immediately  upon
      detecting  an invalid  address on the  command line, rather
      than asking for the message text and entering the send_mail
      request loop.  Redefined the  -no_abort control argument to
      provide the old behavior of going to the request loop under
      these conditions.

n- 6. (10.2)  The  send_mail  "-no_header"  and  "-no_message_id"
      control  arguments,  while  still accepted,  are  no longer
      functional.  They will be eliminated in a future release.

n- 7. (10.2)  Changed  send_mail  qedx  to  require  a  write (w)
      request to  reflect any changes  made to the  message.  The
      quit (q)  request no longer  does an automatic  update.  If
      the  quit  request  is  issued  and  the  message  has been
      modified since it was last written, qedx will now query for
      permission  to exit.   If permission is  given, any changes
      made since the last write request will be lost.

n- 8. (10.2) Converted the in_reply_to request in send_mail to an
      "original"  request  (i.e.,  this request  is  only defined
      within send_mail invocations created by the read_mail reply
      request).  In addition, this  request now accepts read_mail
      message  specifiers  rather  than  a character  as  the new
      content of the In-Reply-To field.


OTHER MAIL UTILITIES


o- 1. (10.1)  Extended the  have_mail command to  accept the same
      mailbox  specification control  arguments as  read_mail and
      print_mail, including -mailbox, -user, -log, and -save.  In
      addition, added  control arguments to  control whether only
      interactive messages,  or ordinary mail, or  both are to be
      checked in  the mailbox; the  default is to  check both for
      compatibility  with   print_mail  and  prior   releases  of
      have_mail.

o- 2. (10.1) Added  the have_messages command  which is identical
      in function  to have_mail, but by  default, only checks the
      mailbox for interactive messages.

_F_O_R_T_R_A_N

      (10.0)  Installed  FORTRAN version  10, which  includes the
      following  new  features.   For  further  details  on these
      changes, type:  help fortran.new_features

p- 1. (10.0)  Changed the  fortran compiler to  make -table (-tb)
      the  default  control  argument  except  when  -optimize is
      specified.   When  the  -optimize  control  argument  is in
      effect,  the  default  is  -no_table  (-ntb).   This change
      automatically produces a symbol table, making it easier for
      programmers to debug FORTRAN  programs.  However, users who
      are compiling  FORTRAN programs for  production runs should
      be warned to  use -optimize to avoid the  symbol table (and
      incidentally,   to   gain   the   significant   performance
      improvements of optimization).

p- 2. (10.0)  Added  the  -check_multiply  (-ckmpy)  argument  to
      generate   code   to   check  for   overflows   in  integer
      multiplication.

p- 3. (10.0) Changed the defaults for nonoptimized compilation in
      ansi77  mode to  be -subscriptrange  (-subrg), -stringrange
      (-strg),  and  -check_multiply   (-ckmpy).   There  are  no
      changes  effecting  ansi66  mode  for  these  three control
      arguments  (-no_check_multiply  is the  default  for ansi66
      mode).  These control arguments  can be overridden by their
      respective   negative   control   arguments,   which   are:
      -no_subscriptrange (-nsubrg), -no_stringrange (-nstrg), and
      -no_check_multiply (-nckmpy).

p- 4. (10.0) Changed the processing of ENDFILE to be in line with
      that defined in the FORTRAN Standard.

p- 5. (10.0) Changed formatted logical input to be in conformance
      with the  FORTRAN standard.  The input  routines now accept
      any one of the four  character strings ".t", ".T", "t", and
      "T" as being TRUE.

p- 6. (10.0)  Changed  the value  of  the IOSTAT  variable  to be
      negative  if  the READ  detects  an end  of  file to  be in
      compliance with the FORTRAN standard.

      (10.1) Installed FORTRAN version  10.1 which includes minor
      bug fixes.

p- 7. (10.1)  Changed  namelist  and  list directed  I/O  when in
      ansi77  mode  to  make  output more  readable  and  more in
      compliance with the Fortran Standard.






Contents of MR10.2            3-55                        SRB10.2


     ox    character values are now  enclosed in apostrophes after
          removing any trailing spaces
     ox    space has been inserted before namelist variable names
     ox    leading  spaces  have been  removed from  numerical and
          logical values
     ox    nonsignificant  trailing zeros  have been  removed from
          numeric values
     ox    real and complex values are output in G-format

p- 8. (10.2) This version of FORTRAN allows programs to use large
      and very large arrays.  Large arrays (LAs) are individually
      less than one segment long,  but in aggregate, require more
      space  than  previously available  for automatic  or static
      storage.  Very large arrays (VLAs) are each larger than one
      segment.  Type "fortran_large_arrays.gi.info" for details.

      Programs  that  use  several LAs/VLAs  could  affect system
      performance.   System administrators  should be  careful in
      assigning disk  space to the directories  which are to hold
      the  extended  storage segments.   By default,  storage for
      LA/VLAs  is placed  in the  process directory.  Optionally,
      the  user   can  give  another  pathname   by  setting  the
      fsm_dir_dir_path variable in the  value segment.  (Refer to
      the MAM-System, Order No.  AK50 for more information.)

      LAs/VLAs  use segments  that are  a full  256K long.  After
      running  a program  with this  feature, the  process switch
      that controls use of 256K  segments is left on.  This means
      that programs  in general can  reference all 256K  words of
      any segment that  has a max length of  256K.  However, some
      system  and user  programs may  not work  correctly in this
      mode.  For example, an intended  reference to the last word
      may in fact turn into a  reference to the first word.  This
      is due to hardware  limitations in certain instructions not
      used  for  LA/VLAs.  This  mode  can be  turned off  by the
      process_switch_off  command with  the keyword  256K.  There
      should be no trouble as long as the use of 256K segments is
      only    through   FORTRAN    LAs/VLAs.    The    value   of
      sys_info$max_seg_size will remain at 255K.

p- 9. (10.2) Other FORTRAN changes include:

a.  Improved ability to see variables through 'probe'.  PARAMETER
    defined variables are now visible to 'probe'.
b.  Improved  stability  of optimized  compilation  and optimized
    I/O.
c.  Numerous bug fixes.
d.  Improved listing output information.
e.  '77 mode conforms better to the '77 Standard, particularly in
    I/O.
f.  Many  I/O restrictions  have been  weakened or  removed, so a
    program  is  less likely  to terminate  prematurely due  to a
    fatal I/O error.
g.  Changed  processing of  the PAUSE statement  so that programs
    using  it  can  be  run absentee.   A  PAUSE  now  raises the
    condition  'fortran_pause',  which  can  be  handled  by 'on'
    condition handling.
h.  Conformance  to ANSI  Standards for  FORTRAN has  resulted in
    some changes in output formatting:
      - In both '66  and '77 modes, the type  of exponent ('D' or
        'E') for  a datum output through  a D, E or  G format was
        determined  by  whether the  datum  was double  or single
        precision.   This  is contrary  to both  the '66  and '77
        Standards.  The exponent type is now determined according
        to these Standards.  'D' is used  for D format and 'E' is
        used  for  E  and  G formats.   This  change  should have
        minimal impact since there  is no distinction between 'D'
        and 'E' type exponents in list-directed input or in D, E,
        F, and G formatted input.
      - In '77  mode, T, TL,  TR, and X output  formats no longer
        transmit  characters to  the output record  nor alter the
        record length; they merely  alter the current position in
        the  record.   This change  may invalidate  programs that
        relied on the old action  to create files of fixed length
        records.
      - List-directed  output  in '77  mode has  had a  number of
        changes:  double  precision values are now  output in the
        same  format  as  real  values,  except  more  digits may
        appear; the  fraction part of floating  point values will
        contain at least one digit;  a floating round rather than
        a fixed  round to decimal  is used (so,  for example, 0.1
        will print as 0.1  rather than as 0.099999999); character
        values   are  no   longer  separated   from  a  following
        noncharacter   value;  and   a  space   carriage  control
        character is  always supplied unless the  output unit has
        the 'carriage' attribute.

p-10. (10.2) Collected all of the MR10.2 FORTRAN runtime routines
      into  a  single bound_fortran_runtime_  which  replaces the
      previous  bound_fortran_io_.   This  segment  contains  all
      specific  FORTRAN  runtime  routines  and  runtime  support
      routines, and all routines written in FORTRAN.

p-11. (10.2) FORTRAN  programs may receive new  ERROR 2 messages,
      indicating  parameter  incompatability when  argument lists
      are inconsistent.  This is because FORTRAN now compares the
      argument  list of  subprogram references  with the argument
      list associated with the  entry definition (if one exists).
      Warning messages are provided when calling sequences do not
      match  what  the subprogram  expects.   Previously, FORTRAN
      used the first subprogram reference in a program/subprogram
      as the key to compare subsequent references with, this will
      still be done when no  entry definition can be found (i.e.,
      the subprogram is external).

p-12. (10.2) ANSI-77  FORTRAN programs that rely  on the transfer
      of control into the range of a DO - loop will now receive a
      severity  3 error  170.  This  is in  conformance with ANSI
      X3.9-1978 11.10.8..1

p-13. (10.2)    FORTRAN   now    recognizes   the   STATUS=DELETE
      specification in  the CLOSE statement for  any file that it
      has attached and opened.  Previously, one could only delete
      a  file  if  it  was CREATED  by  the  last  OPEN statement
      executed for that file.

      The fortran_io_ subroutine now  pads tape records on output
      (via tape_nstd_) to full word multiples.

p-14. (10.2)  The MR10.2  FORTRAN release  trims extraneous white
      space in list-directed output,  formats to simplify output,
      and  permits the  programmer to utilize  this output format
      without   extra   output    spacing   and   delays.    This
      simplification only affects programs running under ANSI-77;
      thus  existing  ANSI-66  programs  are  not  affected.  The
      statement:

           print *,"Number of steps:  ", integer

      produces the following ANSI-66 output:

           Number of steps:                 1

      and produces the following ANSI-77 output:

           Number of steps:  1

p-15. (10.2)   Added   features  to   FORTRAN  to   increase  its
      meterability,  and  extended  the  ability  to  use FORTRAN
      routines in MRDS.  A  slight improvement in execution speed
      for un-optimized compilations has also resulted.

      Added entry parameter descriptors  for all FORTRAN external
      entrypoints.   This   allows  MRDS/LINUS  to   use  FORTRAN
      routines as encode/decode procedures, etc.

      FORTRAN now supports the 'long_profile' feature, previously
      only  available  in  pl1.   This permits  the  user  to get
      measured real statistics of  program execution, timing, and
      page faulting.

      Enhanced   the  efficiency   of  loop   generation  in  the
      non-optimizing code generator to improve average efficiency
      and  prevent   situations  which  could   cause  efficiency
      degradation through loop word alignment.

p-16. (10.2)  Until  now,  a  FORTRAN control  argument  could be
      silently ignored  if a conflicting %global  was included in
      the source being compiled.  This problem is now eliminated.
      Control arguments now take precedence over %global.

      Subscriptrange, stringrange, and  the check_multiply option
      are now the default when "ansi77" is specified as a %global
      or control argument.  Previously,  these defaults were only
      set  for the  -ansi77 control argument,  thus leaving users
      with only  a %global ansi77 without  the defaults indicated
      in documentation.

      Every compilation  option now has a  converse option.  Thus
      every  %global can  be overriden  and almost  every control
      argument can be superceded by a subsequent argument.  Added
      the  following  new   user  options:   long,  default_full,
      full_optimize, no_check,  no_fold, no_line_numbers, no_map,
      no_optimize,   no_large_array,   no_very_large_array,   and
      no_vla_parm.  Renamed  the 'safe' option  to 'default_safe'
      which is now allowed as a control argument as well as being
      a legal  argument to %global and  %options.  Also added new
      control  arguments  to   correspond  to  existing  %global:
      -auto, -free, and -static.

p-17. (10.2) Changed the set_cc command  to set the defer newline
      mode  for  any  specified  FORTRAN  file  from  outside the
      FORTRAN program.


_F_o_r_u_m

      (10.0) Installed a new  Electronic Meetings facility, forum
      version 1.8.



Contents of MR10.2            3-59                        SRB10.2


q- 1. (10.0) Added a new forum command.  Forum is a sophisticated
      electronic  meeting  facility, which  has been  widely used
      internally  for over  a year.   It is  an outgrowth  of the
      experimental facility called continuum.

      Forum provides facilities for  a controlled meeting between
      widely dispersed people in both time and physical location.
      It allows users to  peruse chained transactions, respond to
      other  transactions, and  enter new  transactions.  It also
      provides control over who can create and attend meetings.

q- 2. (10.0) Added new commands to support Forum:

     forum_list_meetings, flsm
          lists meetings found in the user's forum search paths.

     forum_list_users, flsu
          lists users attending a particular meeting.

     forum_dir, fd
          displays  or returns  the pathname of  the default site
          meeting directory.

     forum_accept_notifications, fant
          notifies  the  user  when  transactions  are  added  to
          meetings in which the user has asked for notification.

     forum_refuse_notifications, frnt
          turns off forum notifications.

     forum_create, fcr
          creates a new meeting.

     forum_delete, fdl
          deletes an existing meeting.

     forum_add_participant, fapt
          adds person_ids to the ACL of a particular meeting.

     forum_remove_participant, frpt
          prevents   particular   person_ids  from   attending  a
          meeting.

     forum_add_project, fapj
          adds project_ids to the ACL of a particular meeting.

     forum_remove_project, frpj
          prevents members of a particular project from attending
          a meeting,  unless they are granted  specific access by
          their person_id.

     forum_make_public, fmp
          allows anyone to access a particular meeting.


Contents of MR10.2            3-60                        SRB10.2


     forum_unmake_public, fump
          requires  that  people attending  a meeting  be granted
          access by person_id or project_id.

     forum_admin
          performs site administration  functions associated with
          the Forum facility.

      For  further  details, refer  to  the Multics  Forum User's
      Guide, Order No.  CY74.

      (10.1)   Installed  Electronic   Meetings  facility,  forum
      version 1.9.

q- 3. (10.1)  Added  the  following  new  requests  to  the forum
      command:

     ox    delete_participant request to allow  a chairman to mark
          attendee records for deletion.
     ox    retrieve_participant   request   to   retrieve  deleted
          attendee records at any time prior to expunging.
     ox    expunge  request   to  allow  a   meeting  chairman  to
          physically   compact   meetings  by   removing  deleted
          transactions and participant records.

q- 4. (10.2)    Installed    forum    version    1.10.    Changed
      (incompatibly)  the qedx  and ted  commands to  require the
      write request  be explicitly given.  The  editors now query
      if the user attempts to quit with modified buffers.

      Replaced        the        forum_$forum_add_name        and
      forum_$forum_delete_name entries with forum_$chname_forum.

      Moved the  forum_chairman_$delete_forum entry to  forum_ so
      that  any  user with  modify  permission on  the containing
      directory can delete a meeting.

      Changed the definition of the restref transaction specifier
      to no longer include the current transaction.

      Added the  capability to allow authors  to delete their own
      transactions and to select transactions by date-time.


_G_C_O_S

      (10.0 and  10.1) Changed GCOS version  2.5 and GTSS version
      2.9 to correct several problems and add enhancements.







Contents of MR10.2            3-61                        SRB10.2


r- 1. (10.0) Added the -block (-bk)  control argument to the gcos
      command to specify, in words, the block size to be used for
      the gcos  tape buffer (NOTE:  This  requirement was removed
      in MR10.2.  See item p-8  below).  The default is 2800 with
      a  maximum  of 4096.   For  buffer sizes  greater  than the
      default    the    user    must    have    rw    access   to
      >sc1>rcp>workspace.acs.

r- 2. (10.0) Changed GCOS SYSOUT  routines to place printer/punch
      files  produced  by  the  batch  simulator  in  the  SYSOUT
      directory specified by the -syot_dir control argument.

r- 3. (10.0) Added the  help request to GCOS Daemon  to display a
      brief list of Daemon requests  available to the user.  Also
      fixed  Gcos  Daemon  to  resolve duplicate  SNUMB  names by
      querying the user rather than aborting.

r- 4. (10.0)  Added the  gcos_label_tape (gclt) tool  to the GCOS
      Environment  Simulator  to write  a GCOS  label on  a tape.
      Optionally,  gclt erases  the contents  of the  tape before
      writing the  label to provide an  added measure of security
      when  using  Multics  tapes  to transport  files  from GCOS
      systems to Multics systems for use under the Simulator.

r- 5. (10.1) Added  support of concurrent access  control for IDS
      II  applications run  under the  GCOS Environment Simulator
      gcos command.

r- 6. (10.1) Changed gcos tape buffer to allow use of block sizes
      greater than 2800 without rw access to workspace.acs.

r- 7. (10.2) Tape  density may now  be specified in  the gcos_fms
      command.

r- 8. (10.2)  The  GCOS Environment  Simulator now  supports GCOS
      software release 4JS3 in both  batch and TSS.  This version
      of the simulator includes the latest update of 4JS3 (Update
      7) available.   Subsequent updates may be  installed by the
      site with the tools included  with the simulator.  The GCOS
      Environment Simulator, Order No.  AN05, should be consulted
      for  an updated  list of  those control  cards, MMEs, DRLs,
      GCOS features, and tools supported.

      The GCOS software includes  only the bundled GCOS software.
      For  example,  since all  GCOS  FORTRAN is  unbundled, this
      version  of  the simulator  does  not include  any FORTRAN.
      This version of the simulator includes tools, including the
      new  gcos_tss_build_library, which  can be  used to install
      separately obtained unbundled or updated GCOS software.

      The  GCOS  SRBs  for releases  from  4J to  4JS3  should be
      consulted  for changes  to the  GCOS software.   One of the
      incompatable  GCOS changes  is a  reformating of  H* and Q*
      files that  require the relinking  of all such  4J files to
      run in 4JS3.

      Removed  the  need  for  the  -block  control  argument  by
      increasing the  default tape buffer size  to the maximum of
      4096 words.

r- 9. (10.2) Added the gcos_tss_build_library command providing a
      tool  to  install GCOS  PSP software  for use  by gcos_tss.
      Type "help gtbl" for details.

r-10. (10.2) Changed the gcos_build_library, gcos_extract_module,
      and  gcos_library_summary gcos  tools to  no longer require
      specification  of  their  input library  format.   They can
      process either native GCOS or simulator format libraries.

r-11. (10.2)  Changed the  gcos_pull_tapefile command  to process
      tape density and tape buffer  (block) size, and changed the
      default buffer size to 3842 words.

_G_r_a_p_h_i_c_s _F_a_c_i_l_i_t_y


s- 1. (10.2) Added the new  increment and synchronize commands to
      the graphics_editor to support dynamic operators.

      The  increment command  increments the  parameter values of
      the single  positional, modal, or  mapping terminal graphic
      element specified by <expern> <count> times with a delay of
      <delay> seconds between increments.

      The synchronize command forces  the graphics system to wait
      for  the  completion of  all previously  received increment
      commands.

      (10.0) Installed  the initial release  of the Inter-Multics
      File Transfer (IMFT) facility.

t- 1. (10.0) Added  a new facility  to allow the  transmission of
      files  and  subtrees between  cooperating  Multics systems.
      The  initial release  does not provide  special support for
      the Access Isolation Mechanism (AIM).  The driver processes
      on  the  cooperating  systems  must  run  at  the  same AIM
      authorization to  insure proper operation.   Utilization of
      this  facility requires  cooperating systems  to have basic
      bisync and HASP protocol support.

t- 2. (10.0)     Added     the     following     new    commands:
      enter_imft_request   (eir),    cancel_imft_request   (cir),
      list_imft_requests  (lir),   and  move_imft_request  (mir).
      Refer  to  the  new  manual,  Inter-Multics  File  Transfer
      Facility Users' Guide (Order No.  CY73).

t- 3. (10.1)  Changed IMFT  to check  the user's  access to every
      file  and  directory in  a subtree.   Where the  user lacks
      access to a file or directory, the transfer does not occur;
      however the transfer of the subtree is continued.

t- 4. (10.1)  Changed IMFT  to never set  the ring  brackets of a
      file or directory it creates  on the target system, to less
      than the write bracket of the user's IMFT ACS segment.

t- 5. (10.1)  Changed IMFT  to properly  propagate AIM attributes
      between systems by:

     ox    determining maximum  access class of  branches that may
          be    transmitted    between    systems,    using   the
          system_privilege_ gate when appropriate




Contents of MR10.2            3-64                        SRB10.2


     ox    translating AIM access class  of each file or directory
          reloaded on the target system

     ox    refusing  to  transfer any  directory if  it has  to be
          created as an upgraded directory on the target system.

          NOTE:  IMFT for MR10.0  and MR10.1 are incompatible due
               to changes made for proper enforcement of AIM.  In
               order  to use  IMFT between  systems, both systems
               must either  be at the same  release level, or the
               MR10.1 system  must revert to use  of MR10.0 IMFT.
               That is,  the system running MR10.1  should save a
               copy of the MR10.0 IMFT (>unb>bound_imft_) for use
               when  communicating  with   another  system  still
               running MR10.0.

t- 6. (10.2)  Enhanced the  Inter-Multics File  Transfer facility
      (IMFT) to allow users to  request the transfer of files and
      subtrees from a remote system.  This feature is not enabled
      by default; the  keyword/value pair "allow_remote_requests=
      yes"  must  be included  (in  the definition  of  the input
      driver in the I/O Daemon  tables on the foreign system) for
      such requests to be honored.

      By default, requests for  remote transfer are restricted to
      files  and subtrees  whose ACLs  contain a  term explicitly
      granting access to the Person_id  of the IMFT daemon.  This
      restriction can  be overridden by the  specification of the
      keyword/value pair "explicit_access= no" (in the definition
      of the output driver in the I/O Daemon tables on the system
      where the files originate).

      Changed (incompatibly) the meaning of  the ACL modes on the
      access control segment (ACS) used  by IMFT to determine the
      foreign  user's  privileges;  "w"  access  now  allows  the
      foreign  user to  send files to  the local  system, and "r"
      access allows  the foreign user to  request the transfer of
      files from the local system.   A tool is provided to adjust
      access  to  the  ACSs  and  is  documented  in  the  MR10.2
      Installation Instructions.

      The  definition  of  an  output  driver  must  now  include
      specification of either one or two minor devices.  Separate
      minor  devices are  used to  transfer files  to the foreign
      site and to request the  transfer of files from the foreign
      site.   (Refer  to  Inter-Multics  File  Transfer  Facility
      Reference Manual, Order No.  CY73 for details.)

t- 7. (10.2)  Changed  the  IMFT  facility to  allow  the  use of
      communications methods other than  HASP.  For example, X.25
      and ordinary  asynchronous links are now  supported.  If it
      is  desired to  transfer files  between a  site running the
      10.2 version and  a site running the 10.1  version of IMFT,
      the keyword/value  pair "version= 2.0" must  be included in
      the  args  statement of  the device  definition in  the I/O
      daemon tables at the 10.2 site.

      (10.1)  Installed LINUS  version 4.0  to fix  several known
      errors.

u- 1. (10.1) Changed LINUS to  use the subsystem utilities, ssu_,
      causing  it  to  more  closely resemble  the  read_mail and
      send_mail     subsystems.     There     are    two    minor
      incompatibilities;  the  execute, e,  and ".."   methods of
      sending a  command to the  command processor are  no longer
      identical, and the comma  (,) and semi-colon (;) characters
      now have  special meanings and  must be enclosed  in quotes
      when used in a LINUS request line.

u- 2. (10.1)  Added  subsystem  start_up exec_coms  to  the LINUS
      subsystem,  version  4.0.  The  start_up,  start_up.lec, is
      searched  for  in the  user's  home directory,  the project
      directory, and the >site.   This feature is controlled with
      the -start_up (default) and -no_start_up control arguments.

      (10.2)  Installed LINUS  version 4.4  to fix  several known
      errors and add several new features.

u- 3. (10.2)  Added  the apply,  qedx,  input_query, print_query,
      save_query,   and   check_query   LINUS   requests   as  an
      alternative   to   the   LILA  editor.    The   LINUS  data
      manipulation  requests (store,  modify, delete,  and print)
      now automatically translate the current  query if it is not
      already done.

u- 4. (10.2)  Added  a  report  writer  to  the  LINUS subsystem.
      Features include:   1) sorting output,  2) column headings,
      3)  totaling   across  columns  and  down   rows,  4)  user
      controlled   page  breaks,   headings,  and   footings,  5)
      hyphenation, 6)  new column title folding  action, 7) group
      header and footer, 8) group  header and footer triggers, 9)
      counts  and  sub-counts,  10)  control  arguments  for  the
      display request,  11) multiple pass  report formatting, and
      12) new display built-in values.

      Added the display, set_format_options, list_format_options,
      restore_format_options,  save_format_options, column_value,
      page_number, picture, and format_line requests to implement
      the LINUS report writer interface.

      The scrolling  feature of the LINUS  Report Writer includes
      the following functions:  1) forward scrolling, 2) backward
      scrolling, 3) left scrolling,  4) right scrolling, 5) help,
      6)  binding  scrolling function  to  keys, 7)  changing the
      scroll height,  8) changing the scroll  width, 9) quitting,
      10) redisplay of screen, 11) goto start of report, 12) goto
      end  of report,  13) multics  mode, and  14) goto line/page
      within the report.


_M_e_n_u _F_a_c_i_l_i_t_y


v- 1. (10.0) Added new subroutine interfaces  to allow a COBOL or
      FORTRAN  programmer to  create, store,  retrieve, list, and
      display  menu  objects.  These  new subroutines  are called
      cb_menu_ and ft_menu_, respectively.

v- 2. (10.0)  Added  subroutine  interfaces  to  allow  COBOL  or
      FORTRAN  programs  to enable,  manipulate, and  disable the
      "windows" in which menus  are displayed.  These subroutines
      are called cb_window_ and  ft_window_, respectively.  For a
      description  of these  new subroutines,  refer to  the Menu
      Creation Facilities manual (Order No.  CP51).

v- 3. (10.2)  Expanded  descriptions of  Multics  System Software
      Extensions  (Priced  Software  Product  (PSP)  SGE6800)  to
      include the Multics Menu Manager Facility and Video System,
      formerly PSP SGD6805.

w- 2. (10.1)  Changed MRDS  to allow data  base administrators to
      restructure  existing  data  bases  through  use  of  a new
      restructure_mrds_db   command.    This  command   enters  a
      subsystem with the following requests:

     ox    create_index  request to  create a  secondary index for
          the attribute in the relation.
     ox    create_relation request  to create a new  relation in a
          data base.
     ox    delete_index  to  remove  the secondary  index  for the

x- 3. (10.1)  Installed ted  command, version 3.0o,  to provide a
      new buffer manipulation strategy.

      The  new   strategy  makes  better  use   of  segments  and
      significantly reduces the amount  of modified pages in disk
      queues.

      SAFE environments  from a previous  release of ted  are not

x- 4. (10.1) Installed  the ted requests  |ax, |cx, |ix  to allow
      speedtype expansion for appended lines.  Added the |comment
      request  to  aid  in  commenting PL1  programs.   Added the
      |dumpl, |dumps, |dumpvs, |dump requests to allow dumping of
      selected lines in octal.

A- 1. (10.2)    Changed    the    consolidated_volume_dump    and
      complete_volume_dump  commands  by removing  the -no_detach
      control argument.

A- 2. (10.2) Upgraded  the manage_volume_pool command  to support
      volume sets and expiration dates.   USE of this new version
      of  the command  IRREVOCABLY CHANGES  the structure  of the
      volume  pool   segment.   Type  "help   mvp"  for  detailed
      information.

C- 1. (10.0)  Changed  the  access  required  to  install  system
      tables.  Installation of the cdt, mgt, rtdt, and sat tables
      is  controlled by  the submitters'  effective access  to an
      access  control  segment,  <table_name>.install.acs.  These
      access control  segments MUST reside  in >system_control_1.
      This change allows site  personnel to restrict write access
      to the actual tables so  that persons authorized to install
      the tables cannot accidentally modify them.

C- 2. (10.1)  Renamed  the  admin  subroutine  to  admin_.   This
      subroutine  processes many  operator commands.   Sites that
      have exec_coms (such as system_start_up.ec, admin.ec, etc.)
      that contain commands of  the form "admin$xxx" MUST replace
      them with commands of the form "sc_command xxx".

C- 3. (10.0) The Answering Service no longer creates missing home
      directories  when  a  user  logs  in.   If  a  user's  home
      directory is deleted or  missing, the Project Administrator
      must create the directory.  The Answering Service continues
      to create home directories when a  user is added to the PDT
      for a project.

D- 1. (10.1)  Changed  the  name  of  the  supervisor  gate  from
      xhcs_$get_stack_ptr   to    hcs_$set_stack_ptr.    Programs
      calling  xhcs_$get_stack_ptr  should  be  updated  to  call
      hcs_$get_stack_ptr.

D- 2. (10.1)  Changed  the link_trap_caller_  subroutine  to call
      trap procedures with  a null pointer for a  0 arg link relp
      rather than a pointer to the base of the linkage section.

D- 3. (10.2)  Moved   the  pl1_operators  segment   for  programs
      compiled  with the  Version 1  PL/1 compiler  to >obsolete.
      User  programs  which  have  not been  compiled  since 1972

E- 1. (10.1)  Changed the  format of the  MST header.   To make a
      system  tape  using the  new  header you  MUST use  the new
      generate_mst  command.  The  new generator  can be  used to
      generate tapes for preceeding  releases of both Multics and
      BOS.

E- 2. (10.1) Enhanced the check_mst  command to detect and report
      overflows  of the  hardcore linkage  segments, definitions,
      and  name table.   The enhanced  check_mst MUST  be used to
      check  tapes prepared  with the new  header and  may NOT be
      used to check tapes prepared  with a header from a previous
      release.  The enhanced check_mst displays error messages on
      error_output and sets a severity indicator (accessed by the
      severity  active function).   Removed the  addname ckm from
      the  check_mst tool.   The enhanced  check_mst can  only be
      used  to  check  tapes  generated by  the  new generate_mst
      command.  To check tapes  generated in earlier releases use
      the >obs>check_mst command.

E- 3. (10.0) Changed the get_library_segment command to no longer
      search >ldd>auth_maint by default.   Sites that have a need
      for such  a directory should  not delete the  links in >ldd
      for auth_maint.control and should retain the control files.
      Sites    that    do    not   have    a    directory   named
      >documentation>iml_info_segments  are encouraged  to create
      the directory  and use it for  site specific info segments.
      The  existance of  this directory is  known by  many of the
      standard library commands.






Incompatible Changes           4-2                        SRB10.2


E- 4. (10.1)  Replaced  the  add_copyright  and copyright_archive
      commands   with  the   new  add_pnotice,  generate_pnotice,
      list_pnotice_names, and display_pnotice commands to provide
      compliance  with  new software  protection  rules.  Deleted
      >tools>bound_copyright_  which contained  the add_copyright
      command,     copyright_archive     command,     and     the
      copyright_notice_ subroutine.

E- 5. (10.1)  Changed  the cv_cmf,  cv_pmf, cv_rtmf,  cv_smf, and
      cv_ttf   translators   to  process   segments   having  the
      appropriate  suffix.   The respective  suffixes  are:  cmf,
      pmf, rtmf,  smf, and ttf.   The cv_XXX command  first looks
      for the  segment source.XXX, and  if found, the  segment is
      translated  and  the output  placed in  source.TABLE, where
      TABLE is the appropriate suffix.   If the source segment is
      not found,  the command looks  for the segment  source.  If
      found,  a  warning message  is  issued and  the  segment is
      converted as with prior  releases.  This compatibility will
      be  removed  in a  future release.   Project administrators
      should   rename  their   PMF  segments  or   add  the  name
      <Project>.pmf to  existing segments so there  is no need to
      change typing habits or exec_coms.

      Updated the master.ec supplied in >tools to inspect the pmf
      archive for  Project.pmf.  Sites should  make corresponding
      changes  to  their   master.ec  segment.   The  undelegated
      project  PMF  repository,  >udd>SysAdmin>admin>pmf.archive,
      MUST be converted so that PMFs have new format names before
      using  the  new  master.ec  for  administrative  work.  The
      conversion may be accomplished by typing the command:

           exec_com >tools>util convert_mr10.1_pmfs

      If  a site  must revert  to MR10.0,  the conversion  may be
      accomplished in a SysAdmin process by typing the command:

           exec_com >tools>util revert_mr10.0_pmfs

      These  commands  result in  an  existing pmf  archive being
      renamed and  a new archive being  constructed with suitably
      named components using a temporary directory.  The exec_com
      provides additional documentation.

E- 6. (10.1)  Changed  the  cv_cmf, cv_pmf,  cv_rtmf,  and cv_ttf
      translators  to no  longer delete  the output  segment just
      because translation failed.  Users  should use the severity
      active  function  to  determine whether  a  translation was
      successful.

E- 7. (10.1)  Deleted the  merge_mst command.   All Multics tapes
      should be made with the generate_mst command.

_T_A_P_E _S_O_F_T_W_A_R_E


F- 1. (10.1) Moved the ntape_ I/O module to the obsolete library.
      Sites should use tape_nstd_.

G- 1. (10.1)  Changed  the  sort_seg  command  to  provide better
      protection from accidental sorting of segments.  If neither
      the  -replace  nor  -segment control  arguments  are given,
      sort_seg asks if the user really wants to replace the input
      segment with  a sorted version.   This may cause  some user
      exec_coms to ask questions that had not been asked in prior
      releases.   The  question  may  be  avoided  by  using  the
      -replace  control argument  to explicitly  request that the
      input segment be replaced by its sorted contents.

G- 2. (10.1) Changed the create_dir command to set directory ring
      brackets to 7,7 by default.   The default can be overridden
      by   using   the  -ring_brackets   control   argument  with
      create_dir.

G- 3. (10.1) Changed the who command to no longer list daemons by
      default.   The  -daemon control  argument  MUST be  used to
      display daemon processes.  Added  the -all control argument
      to list daemon, absentee, and interactive users.

G- 4. (10.2) Changed the qedx quit request to query the user if a
      modified buffer  exists at the time  the request is issued.
      Any  exec_coms required  to quit  unconditionally from qedx
      invocations should be changed to use the either the Q or qf
      request.

      This is a major incompatible change and the site may choose
      to  disable  this  query completely.   To  accomplish this,
      change line 1486 of qedx.pl1 from:

         local_qi.header.query_if_modified = "1"b;

      to:

         local_qi.header.query_if_modified = "0"b;

G- 5. (10.2) Changed  Version 2 exec_com &set  statement to strip
      quotes  from its  arguments, the way  the command processor
      does,  making  a &set  line work  like a  value_set command
      line.

G- 6. (10.2) Changed the trace command to produce meters that may
      not be  compared to meters as  reported by the trace_meters
      command in prior releases.

G- 7. (10.2) Changed the abbreviation  processor to recognize the
      archive  component  pathname  delimiter  (::)  as  a  break
      sequence.   As  a  consequence  of this  change,  abbrev no
      longer  expands  any  abbreviation  whose  name  contains a
      double colon.  Added the .rename request to abbrev to allow
      users to rename any such  abbreviations so they are able to
      continue to use them.

G- 8. (10.2)  Deleted the  subsystem_utils_ subroutine.  Programs
      which  used the  subsystem_utils_ must now  be converted to
      use  the  new ssu_  utilities  which are  described  in the
      Programmer's Reference  Manual and the  Subroutines and I/O
      Manual.

G- 9. Changed tape_archive to  use a version 4 table  that is not
      compatible  with  older   versions  of  tape_archive.   The
      >obs>tape_archive command  must be used when  making a tape
      to  be sent  to a site  which has not  installed the MR10.2
      tape_archive command.

H- 1. (10.1)  Changed  how  send_mail  fills  a  messge  to  make
      send_mail  more  compatible   with  forum.   These  changes
      include:

     ox    changed  the default  of terminal  input to  -fill, the
          default of file input is left unchanged as -no_fill.

     ox    filling,  if  enabled, takes  place after  exiting qedx
          during initial input rather  than before entering qedx.
          This  eliminates  the  previous  behavior  of send_mail
          where the user's qedx  editing request would often fail
          as  the message  in the  editor's buffer  was formatted
          differently from what was visible to the user.

     ox    filling, if enabled, occurs automatically following the
          execution  of  any qedx  or  apply request.   Added the
          -fill  and -no_fill  control arguments to  the qedx and
          apply  request to  allow the user  to control automatic
          filling.

H- 2. (10.1)   Changed  the   -input_file  control   argument  in
      send_mail to imply the -request_loop control argument.





Incompatible Changes           4-5                        SRB10.2


H- 3. (10.1) Changed  the read_mail command to  query the user if
      an attempt is  made to delete a message  which has not been
      listed,  printed,  saved, or  written.  The  -force control
      argument for the delete request may be used to suppress the
      query.   The  query is  an  incompatible change  from prior
      releases of read_mail.

H- 4. (10.1)  Changed   read_mail  and  print_mail   to  issue  a
      reset_more control  order after displaying  each message to
      allow users of video systems to easily abort the display of
      a single message when displaying several messages.  This is
      an incompatible change from prior releases of read_mail.

H- 5. (10.1) Changed the way read_mail and print_mail interpret a
      noncontrol  argument  used to  specify  the mailbox  on the
      command  line.   The  argument   is  first  interpreted  as
      -mailbox STR; if  no mailbox is found it  is interpreted as
      -save  STR; if  no savebox  is found  it is  interpreted as
      -user STR.

H- 6. (10.1)  Added the  -prompt STR,  -no_prompt, -include_self,
      and  -no_include_self   control  arguments  to   the  reply
      request.   The -no_include_self  default prevents  the user
      from receiving a copy of  the reply without taking specific
      action.  This  constitutes an incompatible  change with the
      previous release of read_mail.

H- 7. (10.2)  Changed  send_mail  qedx  to  require  a  write (w)
      request to reflect any changes  made to the message back to
      send_mail.   The  quit  (q)   request  no  longer  does  an
      automatic update.   If the quit  request is issued  and the
      message has  been modified since it  was last written, qedx
      will now  query for permission  to exit.  If  permission is
      given, any  changes made since the  last write request will
      be  lost.  The  new quit-force (Q)  request may  be used to
      abort  unwanted  editing  of   the  message  without  being
      queried.


_F_O_R_U_M


I- 1. (10.2) Installed forum version  1.10.  Changed the qedx and
      ted  commands to  require the  write request  be explicitly
      given.  The editors now query  if the user attempts to quit
      with modified buffers.

J- 1. (10.0)  Changed the  fortran compiler to  make -table (-tb)
      the  default  control  argument  except  when  -optimize is
      specified.   When  the  -optimize  control  argument  is in
      effect,  the  default  is  -no_table  (-ntb).   This change
      automatically produces a symbol table, making it easier for
      programmers to debug FORTRAN  programs.  However, users who
      are compiling  FORTRAN programs for  production runs should
      be warned to  use -optimize to avoid the  symbol table (and
      incidentally,   to   gain   the   significant   performance
      improvements of optimization).

J- 2. (10.0) Changed the defaults for nonoptimized compilation in
      ansi77  mode to  be -subscriptrange  (-subrg), -stringrange
      (-strg),  and  -check_multiply   (-ckmpy).   There  are  no
      changes  effecting  ansi66  mode  for  these  three control
      arguments  (-no_check_multiply  is the  default  for ansi66
      mode).  These control arguments  can be overridden by their
      respective   negative   control   arguments,   which   are:
      -no_subscriptrange (-nsubrg), -no_stringrange (-nstrg), and
      -no_check_multiply (-nckmpy).

K- 1. IMFT for MR10.0 and MR10.1  are incompatible due to changes
      made for proper  enforcement of AIM.  In order  to use IMFT
      between systems,  both systems must  either be at  the same
      release level, or  the MR10.1 system must revert  to use of
      MR10.0  IMFT.  That  is, the  system running  MR10.1 should
      save a  copy of the MR10.0  IMFT (>unb>bound_imft_) for use
      when  communicating  with   another  system  still  running
      MR10.0.

K- 2. (10.2) Changed the  meaning of the ACL modes  on the access
      control segment (ACS) used by IMFT to determine the foreign
      user's privileges;  "w" access now allows  the foreign user
      to send  files to the  local system, and  "r" access allows
      the foreign user to request  the transfer of files from the
      local  system.  Users  are advised  to change  all terms on
      these ACSs,  that currently give  "r" access, to  give both
      "r" and "w".

      command is not available  in MR10.2 or subsequent releases.

      compressing strings of space characters into equivalent HTs
      according to standard Multics  tab settings.  Compout files
      intended for  output on a line  printer are slightly longer
      and  the  results  of  compare_ascii  between  old  and new
      compout  files  show  many  apparent  errors.   To compress
      blanks  in  a  compout  file  or  other  segment,  use  the

Reorganized the  MPM set of  manuals for purposes  of clarity and
ease of use.   The six former MPM manuals,  Tools, and RCP Users'
Guide have been consolidated into a new set of three manuals:

     Multics  Programmer's Reference  Manual (AG91)  contains all
            the reference material from the former eight manuals.

     Multics  Commands and  Active Functions  (AG92) contains all
            the  commands  and active  functions from  the former
            eight manuals.

     Multics Subroutines and I/O  Modules (AG93) contains all the

            RELIABILITY AND AVAILABILITY ENHANCEMENTS
                      TO THE STORAGE SYSTEM




_I_N_T_R_O_D_U_C_T_I_O_N

(10.0) This appendix describes  a significant enhancement made to
the Multics Storage System in  MR10.0.  The changes represent the
first phase of a coordinated  plan to improve the reliability and
availability  of the  Multics Storage  System.  The  goals of the
plan are to:

ox    maintain each Storage System volume in a consistent state at
     all times, so that the volume can be mounted and used by the
     Storage System without exceptional recovery action following
     any type of crash.

ox    maintain  sufficient redundancy  in all  Storage System data
     stored on disk to detect likely media failures.

ox    allow a  physical volume salvage  to occur while  the target
     volume is being used for paging.

The changes in MR10.0 achieve the first of the three goals listed
above.  Changes  in futures releases will  address the second and
third goals.


The  remainder  of this  appendix describes  the changes  made in
MR10.0.

An  important feature  of MR10.0 is  the ability  to bootload the
system  following  any  type  of  crash  (with  the  exception of
physical  media  damage to  volumes on  the Root  Logical Volume)
without volume salvages.






Storage System Enhancement     D-1                        SRB10.2


_C_h_a_n_g_e_s _f_r_o_m _M_R_9_._1

In MR9.1,  the recovery time  after a crash without  ESD could be
quite long, as each disk volume  mounted at the time of the crash
required a volume salvage before it could be used.  The following
are  the  characteristics of  MR10.0  recovery which  differ from
recovery in MR9.1:

ox    After a crash, without ESD,  a disk volume which was mounted
     at the time  of the crash can be  used immediately without a
     volume  salvage.    If  a  disk  volume   is  used  in  this
     circumstance, some free records on the volume may be lost to
     the system and  some free VTOCEs on the  volume may likewise
     be lost.  Any  lost records or VTOCEs remain  lost until the
     next time the volume is salvaged.

ox    A volume  which is not  a member of the  Root Logical Volume
     (RLV) are  not salvaged automatically.  It  is salvaged only
     on request.   That is, it  is salvaged only  if the operator
     uses the  salvage_vol command when  it is not in  use by the
     system.

ox    A volume which is a member  of the Root Logical Volume (RLV)
     is salvaged automatically  during system initialization only
     if  there  is  danger  that the  system  might  not complete
     initialization otherwise.   When this happens,  a message is
     displayed on the console.

The effect  of this feature  is that the system  can recover very
quickly after almost  any type of crash.  When  this is done, the
capacity  of  the  disk  volumes  affected  is  reduced  slightly
(capacity here  means number of  available records and  number of
available  VTOCEs).   The  site  can  recover  this  capacity  by
scheduling physical  volume salvages at a  convenient time.  Note
that the  only difference between  using a volume  which has been
salvaged  and  using  that  same volume  without  salvage  is the
apparent  capacity of  the volume  (in terms  of numbers  of free
records  and  numbers of  free  VTOCEs).  Files  resident  on the
volume are not affected by the  salvage, so user data is not lost
by using a volume without salvaging.


_V_o_l_u_m_e _I_n_c_o_n_s_i_s_t_e_n_c_i_e_s

In  MR9.1, a  physical volume  salvage was  scheduled whenever an
inconsistency  was  detected  in  the control  structures  of the
volume  (the  Volume  Map  or the  linked  list  of  free VTOCEs,
specifically).


In MR10.0, these control structures  are maintained in such a way
that it is  not necessary to salvage a  volume prior to attaching
it to  the system.  Inconsistencies  caused by ESD  failure leave


Storage System Enhancement     D-2                        SRB10.2


the  volume  in a  safe state,  and  result only  in the  loss of
records or VTOCEs until the next volume salvage.

Except for the  Root Logical Volume, it is  the responsibility of
the  Site Administrator  to schedule physical  volume salvages to
recover  lost  records and  VTOCEs.  A  volume salvage  should be
scheduled whenever  a particular physical volume  has few records
or VTOCEs unused, if that  volume has inconsistencies.  To assist
the Site  Administrator in determining when  this is necessary or
desirable, the system does the following:

ox    Maintains  a  count of  all  inconsistencies detected  for a
     volume  since  the  last  volume  salvage.   This  count  is
     maintained in  the Volume Label.  This  count is incremented
     by one at the following times:

     -    The volume is  mounted after it has not  been shut down
          properly (e.g., mounted after a crash without ESD, when
          the volume was mounted at the time of the crash).

     -    An inconsistency is detected in the Volume Map.

     -    An inconsistency is detected in the VTOC Map.

ox    When a volume is mounted for which inconsistencies have been
     detected, the following message  is recorded into the syserr
     log:

          init_volmap_seg:  UUUU volume inconsistencies on
          dskX_NN.  VVVV records left.  WWWW VTOCEs left.

     where:

     UUUU
          is the count of volume inconsistencies

     VVVV
          is the number of available free records on the volume

     WWWW
          is the number of available free VTOCEs on the volume

ox    When  a volume  is demounted for  which inconsistencies have
     been  detected, the  following message is  recorded into the
     syserr log:

          fsout_vol:  UUUU volume inconsistencies on dskX_NN.
          VVVV records left.  WWWW VTOCEs left.

     where the meaning of the fields printed is as above.

     In general, the Site  Administrator should schedule a volume

     salvage when  the count of inconsistencies  becomes high, or
     when the count of free records or VTOCEs becomes low.


_S_a_l_v_a_g_i_n_g _t_h_e _R_P_V

The Root Physical Volume (RPV) can be salvaged only during system
initialization.   To do  this, use  the following  BOS command to
boot the system:

          BOOT tape_drive RPVS


_S_a_l_v_a_g_i_n_g _t_h_e _R_L_V

A volume which  is a member of the Root  Logical Volume (RLV) can
be salvaged  only during system initialization.   To do this, use
the following BOS command to boot the system:

          BOOT tape_drive RLVS

During initialization, all volumes of the RLV are salvaged.


_S_a_l_v_a_g_i_n_g _O_t_h_e_r _V_o_l_u_m_e_s

A volume which  is not a member of the  Root Logical Volume (RLV)
can be salvaged when it is not  in use by the system.  To salvage
a volume, use the salvage_vol command described in the MOH.


_D_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y _S_a_l_v_a_g_i_n_g _D_u_r_i_n_g _I_n_i_t_i_a_l_i_z_a_t_i_o_n

Whenever  a salvage  of the  RPV or  the RLV  is requested during
initialization,  all directories  touched in  ring-0 are salvaged
automatically.  These directories are the root (>) and >dumps.


_M_i_s_c_e_l_l_a_n_e_o_u_s _I_t_e_m_s

Changed  the  sweep_pv command  to  optimize file  placement when
vacating a physical volume.  That is, it always moves segments to
physical  volumes  with  the  most available  space.   If several
processes are being used to  vacate a physical volume, all copies
of sweep_pv optimize file placement.  Removed the -no_opt control
argument  as  it is  not  necessary to  inhibit the  volume being
vacated manually.  The sweep_pv command inhibits the volume being
vacated when  it is invoked,  and it leaves  the volume inhibited
when it terminates.

Changed the  output of the display_label  and display_pvte tools.
Refer to the Tools Manual (Order Number AZ03).

Changed  the output  of the  file_system_meters metering command.
Refer to the Metering Manual (Order Number AN52).

Changed  the  layout  of  a  Multics  disk  volume.   Site unique
programs which depend on the layout  of a disk volume may require
modification.   The  changes  are   described  by  the  following
paragraphs.


_L_a_b_e_l

Added new  fields in a  compatible manner, with  the exception of
the  removal of  label.time_unmounted.  Programs  which reference
this  field  continue to  work on  MR10.0 volumes  if recompiled.
Programs which need to operate  on both MR9.1 and MR10.0 volumes,
and  which  reference  this   field,  should  use  the  following
technique.  Examine the new field label.volmap_version.  If it is
1, the  volume is in  MR10.0 layout, and  label.time_unmounted is
valid.   If  it  is  any   other  value,  use  the  include  file
old_fs_vol_label.incl.pl1,    and    take     the    time    from
old_label.time_unmounted.


_D_u_m_p_e_r _B_i_t _M_a_p

This region of  the volume (records 4 and  5) was formerly called
the VTOC Header,  and it also included the  Dumper Bit Map.  With
MR10.0,  it contains  only the  Dumper Bit  Map.  The information
previously maintained in the VTOC Header is now maintained in the
VTOC Map.


_V_T_O_C _M_a_p

This region of  the volume (record 6) was  previously unused.  It
is now  a bit map  of free VTOCEs,  with a header  describing the
number of  VTOCEs on the  volume, the number of  free VTOCEs, and
the  size of  the VTOC (in  records).  Refer to  the include file
vtoc_map.incl.pl1.


_V_T_O_C_E_s

Free VTOCEs  no longer form  a linked list, but  are described by
the VTOC Map.

A  disk  volume in  MR9.1 layout  is converted  automatically the
first time the  logical volume to which it  belongs is mounted on
an  MR10.0 system  (or, for volumes  in the  Root Logical Volume,
during  the  first bootload  of MR10.0).   When this  occurs, the
following message is displayed on the console:

     VTOC Conversion of dskX_NN, volume PVNAME of logical vol
     LVNAME

The  conversion  takes approximately  30-45 seconds  per physical
volume.

If necessary, a  volume in MR10.0 layout may be  used on an MR9.1
system.   When an  MR10.0 volume is  mounted on  a system running
MR9.1,  the  volume  is  salvaged  automatically.   This  salvage
accomplishes the  conversion of the volume  from MR10.0 layout to
MR9.1  layout.  So  it is  possible to  switch between  MR9.1 and
MR10.0,  at  the cost  of a  volume salvage  of all  disk volumes
needed.


_W_I_R_E_D _M_E_M_O_R_Y _I_N_C_R_E_A_S_E

With MR10.0, Multics uses additional wired memory, as follows:

ox    For  each  disk  device  defined  in  the  configuration, an
     additional 80 words of memory (when compared with MR9.1).

ox    Each  disk volume  which is mounted  for use  by the Storage
     System consumes a 4K Active Segment Table Entry (ASTE) while
     it is mounted.

_I_N_C_L_U_D_E _F_I_L_E _C_H_A_N_G_E_S

Changed the following include  files.  Site unique programs which
reference these include files may require compilation:

disk_pack.incl.pl1
     modified  to reflect  the new disk  volume layout (described
     elsewhere in this SRB).

fs_vol_label.incl.pl1,
fs_vol_label.incl.alm
     modified  to reflect  the new disk  volume layout (described
     elsewhere   in   this   SRB).    Added   fields   and  moved
     time_unmounted.

pvt.incl.pl1,
pvt.incl.alm
     split into two files:

     pvt.incl.pl1,
     pvt.incl.alm
          describes the PVT header.

     pvte.incl.pl1,
     pvte.incl.alm
          describes a PVTE.

pxss_page_stack.incl.alm
     reworked considerably.  Site extensions  to ALM page control
     or to traffic control require modification.

vtoce.incl.pl1,
vtoce.incl.alm
     removed obsolete fields.

                           APPENDIX E


                 RECOVERING MASKED FNP CHANNELS




(10.1)  Sites  that  use site-supplied  multiplexers  are advised
that, as  a result of the  changes made to allow  the recovery of
masked  FNP  channels, some  of the  internal interfaces  used by
multiplexers have changed as described below.

New Calling Sequence for multiplexer_mgr_$mpx_crashed

Added  a  bit (1)  aligned  argument, "reload_sw",  to  the entry
multiplexer_mgr_$mpx_crashed,  between  the   mpx_name  and  code
arguments.    This   argument  indicates   whether  or   not  the
multiplexer is to be  automatically reloaded.  "1"b means reload,
"0"b means do not reload.  (The pre-10.1 version always reloads.)
This  entry   is  called  by  as_{NAME}_mpx_   modules  when  the
multiplexer crashes, so  all such entries MUST be  changed to use
the new calling sequence:

declare multiplexer_mgr_$mpx_crashed entry (char(*), bit(1)
   aligned, fixed bin(35));

call multiplexer_mgr_$mpx_crashed (mpx_name, reload_sw,
   code);


New Interrupt Type for Level-2 Multiplexers

A multiplexer that runs as an immediate subchannel of an FNP MUST
be prepared to  accept a new interrupt type,  named MASKED, which
indicates that the multiplexer channel has been masked by the FNP
for  excessive  interrupts.   The  interrupt type  is  defined in
mcs_interrupt_info.incl.pl1.   The  correct  way  to  handle this
interrupt is  to treat it  exactly like hangup, except  to send a
different  wakeup to  the Initializer so  that the as_{NAME}_mpx_
module knows  to prevent automatic reload  of the multiplexer (by
using  the  reload_sw  argument  to multiplexer_mgr_$mpx_crashed,
described  above).  The  multiplexer should be  reloaded later by
means of an explicit load_mpx command.

                           APPENDIX F


                          SATELLITE 6M




Support has  been added to  Multics for the  Satellite 6M product
over an X.25 connection (Marketing ID SHC2572).  This includes an
IO module (rbf_) to allow the use of the Remote Batch Facility on
the DPS6 over an X.25 connection, in the same way it is currently
used  over a  G115 connection.   Also included  is a  command (nr
l6_ftf)  to initiate  file transfers to  or from the  DPS6, and a
special process overseer (l6_tran_overseer_) to allow the DPS6 to
initiate  file  transfers  to  or  from  Multics.   Satellite  6M
includes a  PAD function which allows  terminals connected to the
DPS6 to  log through to  Multics using the  Multics X.25 Protocol
Interface Facility,  a Remote Batch Facility  (RBTX) which allows
remote batch operations such as  printing, card input etc., and a
File Transfer Facility (TRANX) which  allows the DPS6 to initiate
file transfers to or from Multics.

The   following   notes  describe   various   considerations  and
limitations which  need to be  taken into account  when using the
Satellite 6M product.


_M_U_L_T_I_C_S _N_O_T_E_S

1)   The  "nr l6_ftf"  command for  initiating file  transfers on
     Multics  uses an  X.25 dial-out channel  to communicate with
     the  DPS6.   Thus,  the  user   needs  "rw"  access  to  the
     particular  channel  to  be  used,  and  he  also  needs the
     "dialok" attribute as one of his user attributes.

2)   The  process overseer  (l6_tran_overseer_) which  allows the
     DPS6 to  initate file transfers operates  over a normal X.25
     login channel.  In order to  use a special process overseer,
     the user must have the  "vinitproc" attribute.  Also, if the
     user  expects to  be logged in  to Multics at  the same time
     that the  DPS6 initiates a  file transfer on  his behalf, he
     must have  the "multip" attribute.   (This is because  a new
     instance of the user is logged in to do the file transfer).

3)   The Satellite  6M Remote Batch Facility  (RBTX) initiates an
     X.25  connection  to Multics  with  the Call  Request packet


Satellite 6M                   F-1                        SRB10.2


     containing user data  of "rbtx".  In order for  this call to
     connect to the proper IO Daemon process on Multics, a driver
     process should  already have attached an  X.25 slave channel
     which contains "rbtx"  in its user data field.   A sample IO
     Daemon Table definition follows:

     Device:             l6_x25;
       driver_module:    remote_driver_;
       args:             "station=l6_x25,slave=yes,desc=-terminal
                            -comm tty_ -no_hangup_on_detach";
       line:             g.h102.rbtx01;

       minor_device:     printer;
       minor_args:       "dev=printer";
       default_type:     l6;

       minor_device:     punch;
       minor_args:       "dev=punch";
       default_type:     rem_pun;

       minor_device:     reader;
       minor_args:       "dev=reader";
       default_type:     rem_pun;

4)   The  X.25  channel  definition   for  the  connection  to  a
     Satellite  6M should  have the  same packet  size and window
     size  as those  defined in  the Satellite  6M configuration.
     The  defaults  for both  sides are  128 and  2 respectively.
     Notice that  the user of  the "nr l6_ftf"  command must know
     both  the  channel  name  (for the  -net  argument)  and the
     network  address of  the DPS6  (for the  -at argument).  The
     channel name may be a star name, e.g.  g.h102.*.  For direct
     connect X.25 networks, the network address is not important,
     but  must   be  specified  (as  anything),   while  for  VAN
     connections, the network address must be as defined for that
     VAN.  A sample CMF and TTF for a direct connect X.25 channel
     that  supports  remote  batch,  file  transfer,  login,  and
     dial-out is given below.

5)   Some sample  user command lines based  on the definitions in
     the sample CMF, TTF, and DPS6 configuration follow:

     To send a file to the DPS6:

       nr l6_ftf clm >SID>CLM_USER -at 3411 -net g.h102.*

     To receive a file from the DPS6:

       nr l6_ftf >SID>CLM_USER -at 3411 clm -net g.h102.*

     To dial-out to the DPS6 to login:

       dial_out g.h102.* *3411


Satellite 6M                   F-2                        SRB10.2



     In the examples above, the "11" on the network address sets
     the user call data in the X.25 connection request so that the
     DPS6 Listener will answer and do the appropriate thing.  In the
     dial_out example, the "*" in front of the network address
     tells Multics to act like a PAD.

1)  PAD limitations:  If, during  input, the terminal beeps, some
     amount of  input (usually one character)  has been lost, and
     must be retyped.

2)  TRANX  limitations  and additions:   TRANX supports  the "**"
     convention for transferring all of the files in a directory.
     It  does  not  support  multiple file  name  transfers, file
     concatenation, or directory level transfers.



Satellite 6M                   F-3                        SRB10.2


     Blank lines  in Multics ASCII  text files are  stored on the
     DPS6 as records containing a single SPACE (X'20') character.
     When  Multics receives  a record  containing a  single SPACE
     character, it stores this as  a blank line.  Thus, a Multics
     file  which  contains  lines  consisting of  a  single SPACE
     character cannot  be sent to  the DPS6 and  then returned to
     Multics intact.  (The line with  the SPACE character will be
     turned into a blank line.)

     For  transfers  to  Multics, TRANX  requires  the "-MULTICS"
     argument,  the "-ID  user" argument, and  the "-PW password"
     argument.  Where  "user" is the user_id  of the process that
     will  be logged  into Multics to  do the  file transfer, and
     "password" is the password for that user_id.

3)   The  Satellite  6M software  will come  on a  diskette which
     contains an  EC file, INSTALL.EC, which  will install all of
     the  necessary  software on  a  GCOS 6  MOD 400  Release 3.0
     system.

6)   DPS6 Memory and Hardware Requirements for Satellite 6M
                           (MOD400 Release 3.0)

I.  Bound Unit Memory Requirements

     Z_X253 (X.25 Level 3) --  8051 words
     ZNLHPL (X.25 Level 2) --  6296 words
     PAD                   --  4867 words
     RBTX                  --  9357 words
     TRANX                 -- 10493 words
                         -----------------
               total       -- 39064 words


II.  Dynamic Memory Requirements (see Notes below)

     X.25        --  7808 words (default)
     PAD         --  1307 words + 64 words per buffer
     RBTX        --   966 words
     TRANX       --  3268 words
               -----------------
         total   -- 13347+ words




Satellite 6M                   F-6                        SRB10.2


_N_o_t_e_s

      The  X.25 memory  requirements are  tailored to  the packet
      sizes  in  use.  Up  to  six buffer  sizes may  be defined.
      These  are 64,  128, 256, 512,  1024, and  2048 bytes.  The
      default  is  64, 128,  and 256  bytes.  The  initial buffer
      allocation makes 32 buffers of each size, plus 16 extra for
      the largest buffer size specified.  The largest buffer size
      specifies the  largest Level 3  packet that may  be sent or
      received on any link.  During execution the smallest buffer
      which  will  hold the  user's data  is used.   If necessary
      during execution,  the buffer manager  attempts to allocate
      more memory for an exhausted  buffer size.  If more buffers
      cannot  be  allocated,  X.25  continues  to  function  with
      reduced   efficiency.   Periodically   the  buffer  manager
      attempts  to  release  any  additional  allocations  and to
      consolidate the buffers to the initial allocation.  The set
      of  buffers  defined applies  to all  of the  HDLC physical
      links  on  the system  (all physical  links share  the same
      buffer manager).

      The  PAD  dynamically allocates  buffers  of 64  words each
      during execution.  For normal  loads, the PAD generally has
      5  or  6 buffers  allocated.  This  makes the  total memory
      requirements be about 1700+ words (1307 + 5 * 64).

      The RBTX memory requirements  are configurable at link edit
      time, the given values are the defaults.

III. Hardware Requirements

     Requires  a  Voice-Grade  HDLC (DCF6620)  or  Wide-Band HDLC
     (DCF6622/6623)  daughter   board  for  each   physical  X.25
     connection, which will support up to 32 logical connections.

IV. Notes

     The  6M  product  is  NOT qualified  on  the  following DPS6
     models:   6/10, 6/20,  6/40, 6/45, 6/75,  and 6/95.  Product
     qualification  is planned  for the  near future  and will be
     anounced when complete.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
