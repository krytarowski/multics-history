     This  document  has  been  prepared  automatically  from the
system source by Multics Software Support.  Every effort has been
made  to  supply documentation  for each  and every  message that
could appear either on the system console, or in the system logs.
However,  some of  the system messages  are not  provided in this
document due  to the messages developed  prior to the development
of  the  error  messages  document,  or  omitted  in  error.  The
following is a list of modules  that are known to be missing from
this document:

     For each message,  an example of the text  of the message is
provided, followed by four  paragraphs:  Severity, Time, Meaning,
and Action.


_M_e_s_s_a_g_e _E_x_a_m_p_l_e

     The message example  is a literal copy of  the message, with
substitutable fields  shown in all  capitals.  Each substitutable
field is described in the Meaning paragraph.


_O_u_t_p_u_t

     The output  field describes how the  message is output.  For
hardcore  messages  it  shows  the  interpretation  of  the first
argument to SYSERR, which  determines whether the system crashes,
sounds  the  beeper,  etc.   For answering  service  messages, it
describes the output stream and source.


_T_i_m_e

     The  time  section describes  the time  when the  message is
possible.


_M_e_a_n_i_n_g

     The meaning paragraph describes  the situation that prompted
the  message and  the probable cause  of the  situation.  It then
describes  the  consequences  of  the  situation.   Substitutable
parameters in the message example are explained here.


_A_c_t_i_o_n

     The  action  paragraph  describes  what  operator  action is
required when the message occurs.

Ignoring spurious bootload completion interrupt from FNP X

               has  not yet  sent the interrupt  meaning that the
               bootload  I/O  is finished.   Probable cause  is a
               spurious  interrupt  from the  FNP that  stores no
               status; if this happens,  the status that was left
               over  in the  mailbox (probably  from the previous
               FNP bootload attempt)  will be incorrectly reused;
               since   it   probably   indicates   a   successful
               completion  of the  last bootload,  it is ignored.

               indicates  that the  label on  the pack  (NAME) is
               different  from  the user's  request  then special
               instructions from the system administrator must be
               followed.

     Action:   If  the  pack is  correct  then use  the  "x auth"
               function to input the DRIVE and the authentication
               code which matches  LABEL_TYPE:  "ss" for "Storage
               System"  or  "copy  of Storage  System";  "io" for
               "IO";  "urd"   for  "UnReaDable";  or   "urg"  for
               "UnReGistered".  If the wrong pack is mounted then
               use the authentication code "no".



RCP:  Authenticate  DRIVE.  It has LABEL_TYPE  label LABEL and is
UNREGISTERED.


     Stream:   BOS Typewriter (sounds beeper)

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  The tape volume requested is not a registered tape
               volume.   In  addittion, the  system may  not have
               been able  to determine that the  volume loaded is
               in  fact the  one requested.  The  label read from
               the tape on DEVICE was  of type LABEL_TYPE and was
               LABEL.  If LABEL is "(Manual Halt)" this indicates
               that  the tape  drive was  found in  standby while

               non-printable   characters   in   the   label  are
               represented by ".".

     Action:   If the  volume is correct and  is to be registered
               to the user requesting  this attachment use the "x
               auth" function  to input the DRIVE  number and the
               authentication code  on the tape  volume, or "***"
               if   there   is   no   authentication   code.   If
               authentication  was  requested  due  to  the drive
               being  in  standby,  the  tape  should  be rewound

     Stream:   BOS Typewriter (sounds beeper)

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  The  system  cannot determine  that the  volume on
               DRIVE  is  the one  requested.  The  operator must
               authenticate the volume.  The  label read from the
               tape  on  DEVICE was  of  type LABEL_TYPE  and was
               LABEL.  If LABEL is "(Manual Halt)" this indicates
               that  the tape  drive was  found in  standby while
               trying to read/verify the label.  If LABEL_TYPE is
               ANSI  and   LABEL  is  "<label>   (with  non-blank
               accessibility code)" this indicates that the label
               is an ANSI label with a non-blank character in the
               accessibility field, the operator must consult the
               site  standards  for   authenticating  such  tapes
               before    doing     the    authentication.     Any
               non-printable   characters   in   the   label  are
               represented by ".".

     Action:   If  the volume  is correct  then use  the "x auth"
               function  to  input  the   DRIVE  number  and  the
               authentication code  on the tape  volume, or "***"
               if   there   is   no   authentication   code.   If
               authentication  was  requested  due  to  the drive

     Stream:   BOS Typewriter (sounds beeper)

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  This is a warning.  If the system is operated with
               auto registration enabled and exact authentication
               of tape volumes is not required, there is a better
               chance of errors occurring  in the registration of
               tape volumes.  Again, it is very important to make
               sure the volume mounted is  the proper one for the

     Meaning:  The accounting  system was unable to  lock the PDT
               entry for the user NAME in the project PROJ within
               its time limit (usually  five minutes).  This user
               attempted  to log  out or destroy  a process.  The
               entry  was   probably  locked  because   a  system
               administrator or  daemon process locked  the entry
               and then failed.  The system attempts to continue.

     Action:   Contact the system administrator.

     Stream:   as (severity1).

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  The  alarm-clock  channel  has  not  signalled  an
               accounting  update  when  it  should  have.   This
               operation  is  supposed  to  be  done  at  regular
               intervals.   An  accounting  update  can  also  be
               signalled when  a user logs  out, and is  what has
               happened  in  this   instance.   The  system  runs
               normally, but in the event  of a system crash, all
               users may not be  charged correctly for their full

as_init_:   SAT  version inconsistent  with declarations  used in
this program.


     Stream:   as (severity2).

     Time:     System Intialization.

     Meaning:  The  version  number stored  in  the SAT  does not
               match  the  expected  version number,  which  is a
               constant in the  Answering Service programs.  This
               may  be  because the  SAT  has been  destroyed, or
               because  an  incorrect  version  of  the Answering
               Service  programs  is   being  used.   This  error
               crashes the system.

     Action:   Contact the  system programming staff.   They have
               to  either  generate  a  new SAT,  or  install the
               correct version  of the Answering  Service.  If no
               system programmers are available, enter admin mode
               and attempt to retrieve a  recent copy of the SAT.
               Then exit from admin mode and try startup again.



as_init_:  SEGNAME missing, creating new one


     Stream:   as (severity2).

     Time:     System Intialization.

     Meaning:  The  segment  SEGNAME is  missing.   The Answering
               Service attempts to create a new one, and sets its
               ACL   so   that   the  daemons   and   the  system
               administrator can access it.   This message can be
               expected on a cold  boot of the accounting system.
               At  any  other time,  it  usually means  that some
               segment  has been  destroyed by  a previous crash.
               The  system is  able to operate  but some metering
               data and the previous  access control list for the
               segment have been lost.

     Action:   Note for system programmer action.

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  This  message  is  a  repetition of  a  syserr log
               message  which reported  damage to a  segment or a
               physical  volume.  There  will always  be two such
               messages  in  sequence,   a  "Syserr  msg.   #XXX"
               message  and  either  a  "Volume:"  or  "Segment:"
               message.   The  first  message  is a  copy  of the
               logged  syserr  message of  the given  number; the
               second  message identifies  the volume  or segment
               mentioned.  This allows segments damaged by system
               action, or  segments in which  the physical volume
               salvager   observed   damage,  to   be  identified
               unambiguously.  These  messages are logged  in the
               answering service log at answering service startup
               time and every accounting update.

     Action:   Correlate  volume salvager  messages with previous
               printed  volume  salvager  output  to  obtain more
               information about  segment damage detected  by the

     Action:   Contact the system programming staff.  You can try
               logging  the daemon  in again, but  if the process
               error is  recurrent the problem  must be corrected

               threshold.

     Time:     Volume demounting and system shutdown time.

     Meaning:  At some time during the  use of volume PVNAME, the
               system encountered problems  which left the volume
               in an  inconsistent state.  The effect  of this is
               that  some  free  records and/or  free  VTOCEs are
               unavailable   (lost)   to   the   system.    These

     Meaning:  When wakeups are sent from one process to another,

               never calls block to read its wakeups, the ITT may
               overflow.  When  the ITT is full,  this message is
               printed  for   each  lost  wakeup.    The  message

               If so, system operation  may return to normal.  If
               the message comes out  repeatedly, the system will
               have to be crashed, since user terminal operation,

     Stream:   as (severity2).

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  A system  or project administrator  has designated
               that  the  user NAME.PROJ  should  be in  the load
               control  group  GRPID, but  the master_group_table

               will be made to log the user in, using the default
               group for  his project.  Subsequent  messages will
               indicate the success or failure of this attempt.

     Action:   Contact the system administrator.



load_ctl_:  maxu too small (XX), YY units for group GRPID


     Stream:   as (severity2).

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  The  system administrator  has specified  that the
               load control group GRPID is to have "all the rest"
               of the  primary load units after  all other groups
               have   taken  their   allocations  from  maxunits.
               However,  maxunits  is less  than  the sum  of the
               primary  allocations, giving  the group  GRPID the
               negative  allocation  of  YY  units.   The  system
               proceeds,  attempting to  log the  user in anyway.
               Of  course, the  user is  allowed secondary status
               only if he  is allowed to log in  at all.  This is
               often  the result  of the operator  typing maxu 30
               instead of maxu 300, or some similar error.

     Action:   Check the value of maxunits  and, if a mistake was
               made,  correct  it.   If  the  maxunits  value  is
               correct,  note  this   situation  for  the  system
               administrator.

     Stream:   as (severity2).

     Meaning:  The  system  administrator has  accidentally given
               more than one group a  "take all the rest" maximum
               primary unit allocation.  The user control package
               cannot  handle this  situation.  The  second group
               with a -1 maxprim is listed.  The system completes
               startup and users can log  in but maxunits may not
               be obeyed.

     Stream:   BOS Typewriter (Crashes system)

     Time:     System Intialization.

     Meaning:  In  attempting  to  allocate  space  for  hardcore
               segment  SEGNAME, no  more room could  be found in
               any of the defined hardcore partitions.

     Action:   If  this  is a  cold  boot, redefine  the hardcore
               partition of the RPV to  be larger.  At least 1000
               (decimal) records is recommended.  Change the PART
               HC  CONFIG  card  describing the  RPV  to indicate
               this,  and reboot.   If this  is not  a cold boot,
               this  situation is  highly unlikely  and indicates
               damage to  one or more RLV  volume labels.  Volume
               recovery  for  part or  all of  the RLV  should be
               undertaken.

     Time:     System Intialization.

     Meaning:  The  number of  paged segments in  collection 1 is
               larger  than  the internal  buffer in  the program
               make_segs_paged  required  to  sort  them  by main
               memory  address.   This   indicates  an  error  in
               construction of the system  (i.e., too many header
               entries), or may be  symptomatic of main memory or
               CPU hardware problems.

     Action:   If this recurs, revert  to a previous system tape.
               No emergency shutdown is needed.

               recovers from these errors and continues, possibly
               with the  loss of some input  or output.  If ENAME
               is mc.message, some daemon output may be lost.  If
               ENAME is anything else,  some input to that daemon
               may be  lost, and the  operator should communicate
               with  the  daemon  immediately, in  case  this has
               happened.   This  indicates a  logic error  in the

scs_and_clock_init:  Cannot find low order SCU.


     Stream:   BOS Typewriter (Crashes system)

     Time:     System Intialization.

     Meaning:  None of the system  controllers in the config deck
               appear
                    to have a base address of zero.

     Action:   Check the config deck  and bootload processor port

scs_init:  CPU/IOM port range overlap.  Using manual settings for
cycle port priority.


     Stream:   BOS Typewriter.

     Time:     System Intialization.

     Meaning:  The cycle port priority on  the SCUs cannot be set
               optimally  because the  range of  port numbers for
               CPUs and IOMs overlap.  The manual settings of the
               cycle port  priority switches on the  SCUs will be
               used instead.  The  system may experience problems
               as  a  result,  with  the  typical  symptom  being
               op-not-complete  faults  at random  times  by CPUs
               with   higher   port  numbers   (lower   SCU  port
               priority).

     Action:   Continue  to  operate  the  system  normally,  but
               consult  with  Field  Engineering  personnel.   If
               possible,  the  system should  be  reconfigured so
               that the range of port  numbers of IOMs and CPU do
               not   overlap.    Further,   CPU   should   be  on
               higher-numbered ports than IOMs and Bulk Stores.

               when  the  trailer  segment  was  not  full.  This
               indicates a logic error  in the supervisor, or CPU

     Meaning:  There  are no  more free entries  available in the
               system  trailer  segment,  str_seg.   This  may be
               indicative of software- or hardware-induced damage

               number of logged-in processes  which is vastly too
               large.   A  more  likely  cause  is insufficiently
               large  str_seg.  The  size of  the str_seg  can be
               changed by  the TBLS STR card  in the config deck.
               This indicates a logic error in the supervisor, or
               CPU  or  memory  hardware  problems.   This  error
               crashes the system.

     Action:   Follow  normal  recovery  procedures.   It  may be

shutdown complete except for devices suspended.


     Stream:   BOS Typewriter (sounds beeper)

     Time:     System shutdown

     Meaning:  Some disks could not be  shut down due to hardware
               problems.   Messages   have  occurred  identifying
               these drives  and the problems.   All other drives
               have  been shut  down- their  contents are  not in
               main memory or on the  paging device.  The RPV has
               not been shut down either, so that the system will
               perform some salvaging when it comes up.

     Action:   Attempt to ready those  drives that are not ready.
               When this has been done, retry ESD.  If the drives
               have been made accessible, ESD will succeed with a
               normal  "shutdown  complete"   message.   If  they
               cannot be  made ready, the paging  device (if any)

     Stream:   BOS Typewriter.

     Time:     System shutdown

     Meaning:  System   shutdown,   emergency  or   regular,  has

shutdown:   Cannot run  on CPU  X (BOS  CPU).  Dump  and try ESD.
ERRORMESSAGE


     Stream:   BOS Typewriter (Crashes system)

     Time:     System shutdown

     Meaning:  During  an attempt  to shut  down the  system, the
               system could not run on the BOS CPU.  This problem
               may be due to  hardware or software problems.  The
               system  will attempt  to crash,  which it  may not
               complete.

     Action:   If  the system  does not  complete its  attempt to
               crash, it  should be crashed manually.   It may be
               necessary  to change  the BOS  CPU manually.  This
               can be  done by putting  all CPUs into  STEP mode,
               manually  assigning an  interrupt mask  to the new
               BOS CPU  from the bootload  SCU maintenance panel,
               taking only the new BOS  CPU out of STEP mode, and
               doing an  EXECUTE SWITCHES on that  CPU.  Once the
               system has crashed successfully,  an ESD should be
               attempted.  This will most likely succeed.



shutdown:   Condition  CCCC  signalled  during  shutdown.  Normal
shutdown failed.  Try an ESD.


     Stream:   BOS Typewriter (Crashes system)

     Time:     System shutdown

     Meaning:  During  the attempt  to shut  down the  system, an
               unexpected condition has been signalled.  This may
               result from hardware problems, or a logic error in
               the supervisor.  The system crashes and returns to
               BOS, whereupon an ESD should be attempted in order
               to finish  flushing Multics information  from main
               memory.     Because    of   the    difference   in
               implementation between normal shutdown and ESD, it
               is possible  that ESD will not  encounter the same
               problem, and instead be successful.

     Stream:   terminal response.

     Time:     System shutdown.

     Meaning:  This is typed if the operator typed shutdown while
               users are  still logged in  on the system.   If he
               answers yes,  he has in effect  crashed the system
               deliberately.  If  he answers no,  the Initializer
               returns to command level, so that the operator may
               bump the users.

     Action:   A  yes  answer is  an  intentional crash.   Do not
               issue  the  command  unless  the  users  cannot be
               bumped even  by channel id, and  are unable to log
               out.

     Time:     System shutdown.

     Meaning:  Shutdown stops all but the BOS processor.  The CPU

     Action:   Note  for system  programmer action.   If shutdown
               fails, put all CPU's  other than the BOS processor

     Meaning:  The attempt to deactivate all segments in the file
               system  by a  tree-walk of  threaded ASTEs failed,
               likely due  to inconsistent threading  in the SST.
               The segments will be  deactivated by a linear walk
               of   the  SST.    Quota  inconsistencies   may  be
               introduced by  this.  These can be  corrected by a

               During emergency shutdown, this is to be expected.
               During normal shutdown, this may be symptomatic of

     Time:     System Intialization.

     Meaning:  No CPU  CONFIG cards contained  valid (A -  H) CPU
               tags.   Normally this  message will  not appear if
               the bootload  CPU is mis-specified,  as this error
               will be  detected by scas_init, and  thus this may
               be indicative of a supervisor logic problem.

     Action:   Check that  all CPU CONFIG cards  are correct.  If
               not, perform an  emergency shutdown, correct them,
               and  reboot.  If  so, be  sure to  get a  dump and

               the PRDS  defined in the MST  header.  The size of
               the PRDS  will be that defined  in the MST header.
               Further, the  TBLS card in  the Configuration Deck
               has  been changed  to reflect the  minimum size of
               the PRDS

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
