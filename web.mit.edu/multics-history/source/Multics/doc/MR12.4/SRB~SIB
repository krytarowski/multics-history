                            SECTION 1


                           INTRODUCTION




Multics  Release  12.4  (MR12.4)  is  a  supplemental release and
assumes the  prior installation of MR12.3.  That  is, the library
tapes of MR12.3  a free standing release must  be installed prior
to installation of MR12.4.

This  document  includes  descriptions  of  features  included in
Multics Release MR12.4.  Both SRB  and SIB are combined into this
document,  instructions for installing  MR12.4 are included  in a
later section.

Additional  documentation,  including  a  list  of  bugs fixed in
MR12.4, is provided with the release tapes, as printable segments
on  the tape in  a special directory  >doc>MR12.4.  or as  errata
info segsments.  Software Releases prior  to MR12.1 are no longer
supported.   All sites  running pre-MR12.3  software are strongly
encouraged to upgrade to MR12.3 as soon as possible, then move to
MR12.4.

System  Representatives  who  support  Multics  should  apply for
registration  on  the  SiteSA  project  maintained  in Phoenix on
System M.

The SiteSA project was created to allow sites to communicate with
Support  personnel  on  matters  of  site  support.   Only System
Representatives who support a Multics  site are authorized to use
the project.  They are authorized to use it only for site support
activities which require communication  of information to support
personnel.

SiteSAs   should   maintain   their   site's   info  segments  in
>udd>SiteSA>site_info (>udd>ssa>si).   Information on maintaining
these      segments     is      in     the      info     segment,
>udd>ssa>si>site_info.info.



DRAFT:  MAY BE CHANGED         1-1           11/05/90     SRB12.4


In addition  to normal telephone and  Multics mail communications
with  support  personnel,  SiteSAs  are  encouraged  to  use  the
unusual_crash_log  forum meeting  to report  any unusual problems
encountered at  their site.  SiteSAs not familiar  with forum can
type "help  forum" for usage  information.  Forum is  a subsystem
somewhat like the mail system  in which an electronic meeting can
be held.  To invoke forum, type:

   forum >udd>ssa>sa_meeting>uclog

Type  ?  to  print a  list of  requests allowed  by forum.  Other
forum meetings of interest to SiteSAs are:

            PATHNAME                              SHORT NAME
   ---------------------------------------------  ----------

   >udd>ssa>sa_meeting>install_instructions       ii
   >udd>ssa>sa_meeting>hardware_problems          hwp
   >udd>ssa>sa_meeting>critical_fixes             fixes

We would  appreciate that sites as they  complete installation of
MR12.4 enter a transaction in the install_instructions (ii) forum
meeting.   This  will  allow  other  sites  to  see the amount of
exposure the release is receiving and to communicate any problems
encountered in the installation procedure.

Support also suggest, very strongly,  that SiteSAs DO NOT attempt
to reproduce site  problems on System M which are  known to crash
the  system at their  site, cause processors  to loop in  ring 0,
etc.   Such problems  should be  reported via  the Trouble Report
system,  and   will  be  verified  by   support  personnel  using
appropriate   resources,  so  that   System  M  service   is  not
interrupted unnecessarily.

Problems encountered  while installing this release,  or problems
of  a critical  nature to  a customer  site (for  a definition of
critical,  type:  help tr.priorities)  should be reported  to the
list below:

                            SECTION 2


                        CONTENTS OF MR12.4






_C_O_M_M_U_N_I_C_A_T_I_O_N_S _S_Y_S_T_E_M _S_O_F_T_W_A_R_E




_C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s

 1.   The   undocumented   procedure   canonicalize_   no  longer
      termiates it's input pointer.

 2.   Exec_com has been modified to accept the literal &CR.

 3.   Added  the  subroutine  entry  point  'null_entry_'  to the
      command 'nothing'.  This will enable programmers to perform
      the same function as  calling the command 'nothing' without
      using a  name that can easily  clash with the name  of user
      segments.

 4.   MRDS will  now complain on attempts to  open databases that
      require  the use  of Data_Management  if Data_Management is
      not available.

 5.   The maximum number of  components in a multi-segment vfile_
      has been raised from 900 to 1250.

 6.   Dates are  calculated using the "Pope  Gregory XIII" method
      (after  Oct 4,  1582).  The  full (normally  4 digit)  year
      instead of the  partial (1 or 2 digit) year  is used in the
      header for the small calendars.

 7.   Linus:  All user data input or output through LINUS will be
      rounded to  the precision of  the target before  storage or
      display.

 8.   Add  the  short  name  'dfi'  for  the 'display_forms_info'
      command.


DRAFT:  MAY BE CHANGED         2-1           11/05/90     SRB12.4


 9.   The   working_dir,  get_pathname,  and   equal_name  active
      functions  now return  quoted strings.   Users may  have to
      modify exec_coms  to no longer use the  double vertical bar
      convention  (   ||[...]  )  to  suppress   active  function
      re-evaluation.


_L_A_N_G_U_A_G_E_S


_C _L_a_n_g_u_a_g_e

A- 1. The  "c_compile" command  has been  modified to  painlessly
      locate the other components  of the c_compiler.  Users will
      no  longer have  to change  their search  rules or forcibly
      initiate these programs (cop, ccom, le and main_).


_P_A_S_C_A_L

B- 1. Pascal's round  operator now correctly rounds  real numbers
      of the form -x.5 to the value -(x+1).o, rather than -x.0 as
      was done before.

                            SECTION 4


                     FCO AND FIRMWARE STATUS




_F_I_R_M_W_A_R_E

The firmware identification for MR12.4 is "IFAD D.6".


IFAD (Integrated Firmware and Diagnostics) tapes, are distributed
to all sites having  valid Field Engineering Hardware Maintenance
contracts.  The IFAD tape is  nolonger distributed as an FCO.  It
is now sent with the MR12.4 release tapes.


T&D  (Test and  Diagnostic) tapes,  are distributed  to all sites
having  valid Field  Engineering Hardware  Maintenance contracts.
The T&D tape is distributed as FCO PHAFGA888, rev.  B.2.


This version of  IFAD, firmware, and T&D modules  has been tested
and exposed on System M in  Phoenix.  The modules are supplied as
part of the  MR12.4 release and can be found  in >ldd>firmware as
part of the LDD_STANDARD tape.  When subsequent IFAD tapes become
available,   it   is   recommended   that   the   site   use  the
deckfile_manager,  dfm, command  to load  the released  IFAD tape
into >system_library_tandd.  The firmware  modules should then be
moved  to >ldd>firmware and  a new MST  tape should be  generated
using generate_mst.


The  MR12.4  release  requires  the  following  firmware revision
levels.


            Disc:  DSC191 -- V1
                   DSC500 -- Y1
                   MSP800 -- L1

            Tape:  MTC0500 -- V1
                   MTP0601 -- T1
                   MTP0610 -- Z2

_F_I_E_L_D _C_H_A_N_G_E _O_R_D_E_R _L_I_S_T

The following list of FCOs should be thought of as a continuation
of the  similar list for  MR12.3.  Sites that  are upgrading from
MR12.3 will need  to verify that FCOs for that  release have been
installed.

As FCOs are completed in Phoenix,  they are sent out to the field
sites.   Some of  the FCOs  affect only  site documentation while
others may  change the hardware to improve  system reliability or
maintainability.   An example  might be  a change  to improve the
supply  of cooling  air to  some boards  so that  the boards  run
cooler  and are therefore  less likely to  fail.  These types  of
FCOs are important to the  long-term success of system operation.
However,  because these  FCOs are   not required  to correct  the
results of any computer program, they are not listed in this SRB.

The purpose of this section is to identify those FCOs that are of
utmost  importance in  the short  term.  This  list includes only
those FCOs needed to correct a program malfunction.

For those FCOs already sent to the field, the "FCO Kit Ship Date"
column  contains the  approximate date  when shipment  of the FCO
kits began.


One of the  column headings in the tables on  the following pages
is "Round Robin".  The implications of a "Yes" in this column for
a particular FCO are as follows:

1.   The FCO kit  includes at least one board.   The new board(s)
     is to replace the board(s) now in the equipment.

2.   Enough FCO kits are put together  for about 20% of the sites
     that are to take part in  the Round Robin.  Some FCOs result
     in a Round Robin for all  sites.  Other FCOs involve a Round
     Robin for some sites but  not for other sites.  For example,
     two  of  the  factors  that   determine  whether  or  not  a
     particular site takes part in a Round Robin FCO are:

     a.   The date codes of certain integrated circuit chips on a
          board.

     b.   The   board  construction    method  --   wirewrap  vs.
          multilayer.




Firmware Status                4-2                        SRB12.4


3.   The  set of  FCO kits  are sent  to the  first set of sites.
     (For the  remainder of this  discussion, we will  follow one
     kit as it makes its Round Robin journey.)

4.   The site installs the FCO.   When the site is satisfied that
     the FCO  is satisfactory, the site returns  the old board(s)
     to Phoenix.

5.   If there is still equipment at other sites that have not had
     the  FCO  installed,  the  returned  board(s)  is  reworked,
     tested, and another FCO kit is assembled in Phoenix and sent
     to the next site.

6.   Since the length  of time it takes a site  to install an FCO
     and become satisfied that it  is working correctly cannot be
     known in advance,  there is no way to  predict with accuracy
     how long it will be until  the FCO has been installed at all
     sites.


The FCOs have been classified into the following categories:


_C_A_T_E_G_O_R_Y__1 - The  new  software  for  this  release  will not run

                            SECTION 5


                    INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS






The  following  installation  instructions  have  been tested and
verified  by support.  Phase  1 of the  installation must be  run
prior  to the required  shutdown and bootload  of the new  MR12.4
hardcore.  Phase 2 of the installation is designed to be executed
while running normal service.  It is recommended that phase 2 not
be  run  while  the  system  is  heavily  loaded  because  of the
additional load presented.


The installation of MR12.4 has been made as automatic as possible
through  the  use  of  the  master  installation exec_coms called
MR12.4_phase_1.ec  and MR12.4_phase_2.ec.   The matter  of access
and  quota  has  not  been  factored  into  the  execution of the
exec_coms and it is the installer's responsibility to ensure that
this  is   not  a  problem.    Sample  exec_coms  used   in  this
installation appear later in this section.


It  is   recommended  that  the  installation  be   done  by  the
Repair.SysDaemon  as this assures  correct access to  the library
directories and installation gates used  in this release.  If the
installer  wishes to  use some  other person_id.project_id,  then
access should be checked on  the directories, segments, and gates
used in this installation.


The total size of the MR12.4 release directories is approximately
XXXX  records.  In  order to  install all  PSP products  into the
online libraries  (step 4), a  total of 12000  records are needed
under  >ldd.  This  additional storage  is temporary  and may  be
deleted when  the site is  satisfied that reversion  to MR12.3 is
not necessary.


The time  required to install  MR12.4 is approximately  one hour.
If problems occur with these installation procedures contact:

Step 1

     While    running   under    the   current    system,   login
     Retriever.SysDaemon, and type:

     reload -nosetlvid -noquota

     This causes the data on the  single MR12.4 tape to be loaded
     into the directory:


     >library_dir_dir>MR12.4

     Step 2

     This step starts Phase 1 of the installation.

     Login as Repair.SysDaemon and type:

     cwd >ldd>MR12.4 ec MR12.4 phase_1

     Output  from  the  mst  command  executed  in  this  exec is
     >>>>>??????>>>> right now, test it too see eh.

     Step 3

     Shut down the  system at a convenient time  and reboot using
     the newly created MR12.4 MULT tape.

     Resume normal service at this time.

     In  the event  it becomes  necessary to  revert the hardcore
     installation, reboot  the system with the  previous existing
     tape.



















Installation Instructions      5-2                        SRB12.4


     Step 4 - PART A

     The direction in Part A should  only be followed if the site
     has   sufficient   quota   under   >ldd   for  the  complete
     installation as discussed in  the opening paragraphs of this
     section.  Otherwise  follow the directions in Setp  4 Part B
     below.

     This step  starts Phase 2  of the installation  and installs
     changes  to the online  libraries.  The individual  parts of
     this   release  are    contained  in   separate  directories
     subordinate  to  >ldd>MR12.4.   *****Do  we  have  and PSP**
     ********** changed products.  Such  PSP directories will not
     exist  if the  site has  not ordered  the corresponding  PSP
     product.   Only   those  directories  found  to   exist  are
     installed.

     Login as Repair.SysDaemon and type:

     cwd >ldd>MR12.4 ec MR12.4 phase 2


     Continue on to Step 5.



     Step 4 - PART B

     If  12000 records  of unused  quota are  not available under
     >ldd, then proceed as follows.

     The release is  packaged in such a way that  none of the six
     parts are dependent on any of  the other parts.  This can be
     handy if quota is a problem and only one part of the release
     can be loaded  out at a time.  The MR12.4  phase 2.ec may be
     run as many times as needed.

     Execute a login as Repair.SysDaemon and type:

     cwd >ldd>MR12.4 ec MR12.4_phase_2

     Answer yes to install any part of the release that would not
     cause   quota   problems.    Answer   no   to  postpone  the
     installation.

     This phase of the installation can be repeated any number of
     times until the complete release is loaded out.  Remember to
     run Step 5 in order to regain used storage.


     Step 5




Installation Instructions      5-3                        SRB12.4


     The following  instructions should be executed  when you are
     satisfied  that  the  installed  software  is  stable.   Old
     release  software replaced  by  the  execution of  the above
     instructions has been renamed  with a screech name.  Execute
     a login or Repair.SysDaemon and type:

     cwd >ldd>MR12.4

     ec cleanup_library

     Step 6

     After the  complete installation is done and  the cleanup of
     libraries has taken place,  the directory >ldd>MR12.4 should
     be deleted.


     REVERTING BACK TO OLD-RELEASE SOFTWARE (PHASE 2)

     In  the event  it becomes  necessary to  revert back  to the
     old-release software in the  online libraries, the following
     step  should be  executed.  Note   that this  step does  not
     execute correctly if Step 5 above has been processed.

     Without  shutting the  system down,  login Repair.SysDaemon.
     For that portion of MR12.4 to be backed out, type:

     cwd >ldd>MR12.4

     us  de_install  <name>  (where  name  is  <name>.io  of  the
     installation to be backed out)

     Repeat this command  for any other portions of  MR12.4 to be
     reverted.

     This completes deinstallation of MR12.4 portions thereof.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
