                            SECTION 3


                        CONTENTS OF MR12.1






_C_O_M_M_U_N_I_C_A_T_I_O_N_S _S_Y_S_T_E_M _S_O_F_T_W_A_R_E

 1.   Enhanced  the   HASP  workstation  support  to   allow  the
      workstation console to be configured as a login channel.  A
      user  can  login  and  start  up  the  daemons necessary to
      service  the workstation's   devices using  standard system
      interfaces.  The workstation console can  only be used as a
      printing  terminal, which  does  not  support Emacs  or the
      Video system.

      Installed  the  iod_set_line  command  to  allow  the  line
      specification    of   a     device   configured    in   the
      iod_working_tables to be dynamically modified.  This allows
      the  line  specified  for  Type  II  remote  stations to be
      changed and allows  different modems/communication lines to
      be used by a remote station.

      Installed   the  logout_on_hangup=yes/no   option  to   the
      remote_driver_ IO module.  This causes the daemon to logout
      when the communication line is hungup.  Normally the daemon
      reinitializes.

 2.   Changed the version of terminal type table.  Execute cv_ttf
      to convert any  existing ttt files to the  new format.  Any
      programs that reference  ttt.incl.pl1 directly, rather than
      calling ttt_info_, will have to  be changed to accept a new
      version of the terminal type table.  Added an option to the
      terminal  type  entries  to  establish  a  dependency for a
      specific terminal.

 3.   Made      an     upwards      compatible     change      to
      ttt_info_$terminal_data  to provide   additional data  in a
      version        3        terminal_type_data        structure
      (terminal_type_data.incl.pl1).   Versions 1   and 2  of the
      structure are  still accepted by ttt_info_.   However, when
      programs  referencing the  include file  are recompiled for
      other  reasons, they  have to  be upgraded  to use  the new
      version 3 structure.

 4.   Enhanced  the TTF.ttf  to include  some new  TTF entries as
      follows:

      RICOH_PRINTER_PORTRAIT, RICOH_PRINTER_LANDSCAPE and
      RICOH_PRINTER_ELITE  for use  with a  RICOH laserwriter  to
      process remote print requests.

      Added  MOWSE_ANSI  (MOWSE)   and  MOWSE_FANSI  (MOWSEF)  to
      support the Multics Online Work Station Environment.

      Corrected the right and  left cursor character sequences in
      the vt1xx_function_key definition; they were reversed.


_O_P_E_R_A_T_I_N_G _S_Y_S_T_E_M _S_O_F_T_W_A_R_E


_B_C_E

A- 1. The system bootload message,  "Enter boot tape MPC model:",
      which defines the type of  firmware needed to load the tape
      controller,  is skipped,  along with  the firmware  loading
      process,  if  the  tape  controller  is  found  to  be in a
      "loaded", operational  state (e.g., FIPS  tape controller).
      The  operator can  still  reload  firmware from  BCE (boot)
      level.

A- 2. Changed the BCE requests "save"  and "restore" to include a
      time stamp of the form "HHMM.m"  at the beginning of all of
      their messages.


_R_C_P_/_R_C_P_R_M

B- 1. Revised    the    error    messages    to    the   commands
      register_resource   and   resource_status    to   be   more
      informative.  When attachment of a volume is attempted with
      incomplete device  attributes, the error code  returned has
      been  changed  from  "resource  not  known  to the system."
      (error_table_$resource_unknown)  to "No  appropriate device
      is available."  (error_table_$no_appropriate_device).

_M_A_I_N_T_E_N_A_N_C_E _S_O_F_T_W_A_R_E

C- 1. Added a new command,  copy_disk_volume, to allow privileged
      users  to copy  data from  one Multics  physical volume  to
      another  physical volume   mounted on  a non-system-storage
      disk  drive.  It  is restricted  to copying  system-storage
      disks.  The  command requires the  names of the  source and
      target  disks.   Provided   several  control  arguments  to
      control the mode of copying, trace the progress of the copy
      if desired,  and suppress or display  informative messages.
      See  GB64   or  copy_disk_volume.info  for   more  detailed
      information.

C- 2. Restored  the  ability  to   issue  reset  and  force_reset
      operator   commands   via   the   send_admin_command  (sac)
      facility.

C- 3. Added  a  new   display_user_messages  command  to  display
      privileged  messages  sent  by   the  Initializer  to  user
      processes via the as_user_message_ facility.

C- 4. Restored  the ability to  use sc_command without  errors in
      shift_change.ec.

C- 5. Deleted  console_report and   sys_full_report as  they were
      obsolete and no longer worked.

C- 6. Added the terminal_report command to replace console_report
      (which was deleted in MR12.0).

C- 7. Changed switch_off and switch_on  commands to allow setting
      of the damaged switch for directories.

C- 8. Enhanced copy_dump_tape and  compare_dump_tape to work with
      hierarchy  dump information  stored in  vfiles, as  well as
      with   tape   data.    Integrated   compare_dump_tape  into
      copy_dump_tape  to  make  the  commands  work together more
      effectively.

C- 9. Added  support  to   copy_mst,  compare_mst,  list_mst  and
      excerpt_mst for Multics System Tape data stored in a vfile.

C-10. Removed  the  grandfather  access  given  to *.SysAdmin and
      *.SysDaemon  to submit  proxy  absentee  jobs on  behalf of
      other users.   Now only processes having  execute access to
      >sc1>admin_acs>absentee_proxy_acs can submit proxy absentee
      jobs.    Ring  brackets   are  taken   into  account   when
      determining access.

C-11. Added  a match  and/or exclude  feature to  the azm  events
      request.

D- 1. The  RCP attach comment,  "RCP:  Note (DEVICE)  - MESSAGE",
      that  appears on  the operators  console after  the message
      "RCP:  Attached DEVICE for Person.Project" now also appears
      after each "RCP:  Check mount..."  message.  This is to aid
      the operator in mounting the proper volume.

D- 2. Added a new operator command, set_time_zone (stz), to allow
      changing  the system  time zone  without shutting  down and
      rebooting.

D- 3. Fixed error preventing operators from sending quit commands
      to  daemon  processes  when  many  message  coordinator I/O
      streams  were  defined.   Up  to  504  message  coordinator
      streams can now be defined.


_U_S_E_R _S_O_F_T_W_A_R_E


_C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s

E- 1. Added a  new facility to the Multics  command language.  It
      is  now  possible  to  redirect  the  Multics  I/O switches
      user_input  and user_output in  a single command  line.  To
      learn more about this facility type "help pipes.gi".

E- 2. Added the disconnect command, to allow the interactive user
      to disconnect the terminal from his/her process.

E- 3. Added  five control  arguments to  the print_motd  command,
      -new_text,     -all_text,     -system,     -project,    and
      -current_project.   See the  Commands and  Active Functions
      manual or print_motd.info for more details.

E- 4. Enhanced the abbrev command with more flexible list control
      requests.   Type ".?"   in abbrev,  or see  abbrev.info for
      details.

E- 5. Modified the  abbrev processor to expand  beginning of line
      abbreviations following active function begin brackets ([).


_D_a_t_e_/_T_i_m_e _S_o_f_t_w_a_r_e

F- 1. Deleted  obsolete  software:   the  set_time_zone  command,
      time_table_data  segment, and  time_zones_.incl.pl1 include
      file.   Programs which  reference these  modules should  be
      changed  to  call  their  replacements,  set_time_defaults,
      date_time_$format and time_names.incl.pl1.




Contents of MR12.1             3-4                        SRB12.1


_M_a_i_l_/_M_e_s_s_a_g_e _F_a_c_i_l_i_t_y

G- 1. Changed the  message facility to make use  of the permanent
      message seen switches in the mailbox.  This means that once
      a  new  message  is  seen,   it  will  not  be  printed  by
      "print_messages -new" in subsequent processes.

G- 2. Changed  mailbox access  control to  require "a" permission
      with "w" or "u", and require s permission with "r".


_P_r_e_a_c_c_e_s_s _C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s

H- 1. Changed  dial_ctl_ to  allow aliases  in the  Person_id and
      Project_id fields of the dial preaccess command.


_P_r_o_c_e_s_s _E_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t

I- 1. Added   send_system_message_  and   system_message_handler_
      subroutines.  They add a  new general-purpose mechanism for
      sending  system  messages  to  appear  on users' terminals.
      Changed  the  operator  "warn"  command  and the inactivity
      mechanism to use the new facility.

I- 2. Changed  condition  signalling  so  that  after  a specific
      condition is  handled by a program's  on-unit handler calls
      to continue_to_signal_ proceed to  the previous stack frame
      instead  of continuing  the search  of the  current frame's
      on-unit  list.  This  allows programs  to have  "any-other"
      condition  handlers  that  are  not  called  for conditions
      explicitly named in an on statement.


_S_u_b_r_o_u_t_i_n_e_s

J- 1. Added  the  timer_manager_constants.incl.pl1  include file,
      which defines named constants which can be used in calls to
      the timer_manager_ subroutine.

J- 2. Changed bit string constants in check_star_name.incl.pl1 to
      be   unaligned,  so   their  attributes   match  those   of
      check_star_name_ parameter  to which these bit  strings are
      passed.

J- 3. Changed  the  organization  and  contents  of structures in
      answer_table.incl.pl1,        absentee_user_table.incl.pl1,
      daemon_user_table.incl.pl1  and  user_table_entry_incl.pl1.
      User-written programs that  reference these structures must
      be adjusted for these changes and then recompiled.  Removed
      the  name  pitmsg.incl.pl1  from  the  pit.incl.pl1 include
      file.



Contents of MR12.1             3-5                        SRB12.1


J- 4. Added   convert_access_class_$maximum   to   determine  the
      maximum access class from a group of access classes.

J- 5. Moved  the  entry  set_procs_required  from  phcs_ to hcs_.
      Access  to  perform  this  operation  is  controlled by the
      Access                    Control                   Segment
      >sc1>admin_acs>set_proc_required.acs.

      The undocumented and obsolete entry phcs_$set_proc_required
      has been deleted.


_T_a_p_e _S_o_f_t_w_a_r_e

K- 1. Added a  -device control argument to  the tape_mult_ attach
      description  to allow  application programs  to specify  on
      which tape drive to mount the tape.

K- 2. Implemented read_tape_and_query command as an ssu_ standard
      subsystem  which   supports  all  the   standard  subsystem
      requests.    Added  the   -abbrev,  -no_abbrev,   -profile,
      -prompt,  -no_prompt, -quit,  -request, -reqeust_loop,  and
      -no_request_loop   control   arguments.    Added   two  new
      requests,   eof   and    records_in_file   (rif)   to   the
      read_tape_and_query  subsystem.    See  >doc>info>rtq.info,
      >doc>subsystem>rtq>*.info  and >doc>ss>ssu.*.info  or refer
      to AG92 for more information.

_C _L_a_n_g_u_a_g_e

L- 1. Added the following routines to the C runtime library:

      getenv,  puenv, getopt,  getlogin, getpid,  getuid, perror,
      time,  times,  clock,  ctime,  gmtime,  localtime, asctime,
      tzset, exec,  sleep, alarm, abort, strtol,  strtod, strtok,
      vprintf,  vsprintf,  vfprintf,  rand,  srand,  stat, fstat,
      access, tough, link, fcntl, ioctl.

      The following environmental variables are set each time a C
      main program is invoked.

      HOME= the process home directory.
      TERM= the process terminal type.
      TZ= the system default time zone.

L- 2. Modified  the  history_comment  command   to  work  with  C
      language source modules.

_E_M_A_C_S

M- 1. Installed Emacs  Version 12.7.  The  compile-buffer command
      (esc-^C  in  most  language  modes)  now  places  the error
      messages in a buffer  named "Compilation Errors" instead of
      "file-output", to remove the  conflict between this command
      and     comout-command    (^X^E).      If    the     option
      "one-error-scan-buffer" is turned Off (it is On by default)
      then  the error  messages  go  in "<buffer>  Errors", where
      <buffer> is the name of the buffer that was compiled.  This
      allows compilation and error scanning of multiple programs.

      If the option "compile-two-windows" is On (default is Off),
      compile-buffer   automatically   splits   the   window   if
      necessary, putting  the error message buffer  in the second
      window.   If  the   "compile-local-display"  option  is  On
      (default is Off) and  compile-two-windows is Off, the error
      messages are  displayed as a local display  (in addition to
      being put in a buffer).   If neither are set (the default),
      a one-line local display  indicates whether the compilation
      is successful.

      If comout-command (^X^E) is given a numeric argument (e.g.,
      ^U^X^E), it executes  the comout-command-to-buffer command.
      This  is like comout-command  except that it  first prompts
      for the  name of the buffer  in which the output  should be
      placed instead of file-output.   In this case, the contents
      of the file-output buffer are not affected.

      If    the    output    buffer    for    comout-command   or
      comout-command-to-buffer is read-only  or has an associated
      pathname  and has  been modified,  the user  is warned when
      prompted for  the Multics command.  If the  user aborts the

O- 1. Installed  xmail Version 4.1d.   Added two new  features to
      Executive  Mail;  the  ability  to  manipulate  interactive
      messages  as  mail  and   the  ability  to  print  deferred
      messages.

      The new features have caused changes to existing menus:

      The "Personalization of Processing  Options" menu has a 6th
      option called "Include Interactive Messages" for specifying
      whether  or not interactive  messages should be  visible in
      mailboxes.  The  "Send Mail" menu  has a new  option "Print
      Deferred   Msgs".   Both   of  these   options  have   self
      explanatory internal info segments.

O- 2. Command processor  escapes are allowed whenever  xmail asks
      questions of the user.


_F_O_R_T_R_A_N

P- 1. Installed FORTRAN  Version 12.0b.  Added  control arguments
      to FORTRAN:   -debug_io (-dbio) and  -no_debug_io (-ndbio).
      The default  is -no_debug_io, that is, do  not call another
      command level after a runtime I/O error.


_M_R_D_S

Q- 1. Added   two   new   control    arguments   for   use   with
      create_mrds_dm_include and  create_mrds_dm_table; -relation
      and -output_file.  See the info segments for these commands
      for  more detail  or refer  to AW53,  Relational Data Store
      Reference Manual.

R- 1. Installed MOWSE  Version 1.0.  Multics Online  Work Station
      Environment  (MOWSE)  provides  the  means  for cooperating
      processes  on Multics and  an IBM PC  or PC compatible,  to
      communicate  with each other  and to exchange  requests for
      information  or  processing.   MOWSE  is  designed to allow
      these processes to be active  in the background while other
      foreground activities unrelated to MOWSE are also running.

R- 2. MOWSE assumes that the processes  on PC and Multics provide
      equivalent  functions.  Every  attempt was  made during the
      design to ensure that the same MOWSE requests exist on both
      machines.    Naturally,   the    manner   in   which   this
      functionality  is delivered  to or  requested by  a process
      depends on the operating system that governs the process.

R- 3. Installed  WSTERM  Version  1.01.   The  MOWSE  Workstation
      Terminal Manager (WSTERM) provides  the MOWSE user with the
      features  necessary  to  carry  on  normal  Multics command
      environment  work  (in  the   foreground)  and  handle  any
      background  message traffic that  may occur, when  MOWSE is
      active.

      Applications Using MOWSE

      Provided  two applications that  can use this  facility for
      MR12.1 are:

      1. Workstation Terminal Manager (WSTERM)

         The  Workstation Terminal  Manager is  a smart  terminal
         emulator  which operates   through the  MOWSE foreground
         subchannel,   and   which   provides   interactive  user
         communications  between  Multics  and  the  PC.  It also
         handles messages produced by background activities.

      2. Background File Transfer Facility (BFT)

         BFT provides  a faciltiy for transferring  files between
         two computers by means  of cooperating processes running
         on each of the computers.   This facility is intended to
         operate  as a  background process  on each  computer, to
         allow   the  user    to  run   foreground  (interactive)
         applications while a file  transfer is taking place.  As
         a result, BFT does not have access to the terminal input
         and  output  facilities.   As  a  MOWSE application, BFT
         makes  use of MOWSE  facilities to communicate  with the
         user.

         Files  are transferred  in  blocks  of the  maximum data
         length  allowed for  the MOWSE  communications protocal.
         Transfers may be initiated by user command or by calling
         bft_ subroutine from an application program.  All output
         from the  bft command is printed on  the terminal, using
         the  foreground  channel.   Messages  generated  by  BFT
         background   procedures  are   printed  via   the  MOWSE
         background message facility.

_M_A_I_N_T_E_N_A_N_C_E _S_O_F_T_W_A_R_E

A- 1. Deleted  console_report and   sys_full_report as  they were
      obsolete and no longer worked.

A- 2. Removed  the  grandfather  access  given  to *.SysAdmin and
      *.SysDaemon  to submit  proxy  absentee  jobs on  behalf of
      other users.   Now only processes having  execute access to
      >sc1>admin_acs>absentee_proxy_acs can submit proxy absentee
      jobs.    Ring  brackets   are  taken   into  account   when
      determining access.

B- 1. Deleted  obsolete  software:   the  set_time_zone  command,
      time_table_data  segment, and  time_zones_.incl.pl1 include
      file.   Programs which  reference these  modules should  be
      changed  to  call  their  replacements,  set_time_defaults,

_P_r_o_c_e_s_s _E_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t

D- 1. Changed  condition  signalling  so  that  after  a specific
      condition is  handled by a program's  on-unit handler calls
      to continue_to_signal_ proceed to  the previous stack frame
      instead  of continuing  the search  of the  current frame's
      on-unit  list.  This  allows programs  to have  "any-other"
      condition  handlers  that  are  not  called  for conditions
      explicitly named in an on statement.

E- 1. Deleted  obsolete  software:   the  set_time_zone  command,
      time_table_data  segment, and  time_zones_.incl.pl1 include
      file.   Programs which  reference these  modules should  be

      date_time_$format and time_names.incl.pl1.


_S_u_b_r_o_u_t_i_n_e_s

F- 1. Changed  the  organization  and  contents  of structures in
      answer_table.incl.pl1,        absentee_user_table.incl.pl1,
      daemon_user_table.incl.pl1  and  user_table_entry_incl.pl1.
      User-written programs that  reference these structures must
      be adjusted for these changes and then recompiled.  Removed
      the  name  pitmsg.incl.pl1  from  the  pit.incl.pl1 include
      file.

F- 2. Moved  the  entry  set_procs_required  from  phcs_ to hcs_.
      Access  to  perform  this  operation  is  controlled by the
      Access                    Control                   Segment
      >sc1>admin_acs>set_proc_required.acs.

      The undocumented and obsolete entry phcs_$set_proc_required
      has been deleted.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
