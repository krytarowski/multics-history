     In order to produce a letter, report, or other document, you must first
create a "segment" that contains the information that will be in the final
product.  This is done with one of the Multics "text editors."  The Emacs,
Qedx, and Ted editors are presented in the Writing Text menu of this tutorial.

     The text editors set up a special environment in which you type just as
you would type a letter on a typewriter.  Then you give a name to what's been
typed and store it as is in a segment.  The editors, of course, also enable
you to change and correct what you've typed, both at the time you type it and
any time later.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
