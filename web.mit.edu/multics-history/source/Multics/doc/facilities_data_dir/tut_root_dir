     If you think of the "directory hierarchy" as an inverted tree containing
all directories on Multics, then there must be a root directory from which
all the others stem.  The root directory on Multics doesn't have a name.  When
a line of "directories" going back to the root is displayed, the root is
indicated by a greater-than character (>) at the left.  For example, when you
use the print_wdir command, it prints your working directory and the path back
to the root:

>user_dir_dir>Mktg>Jones

     The directory immediately following the root, named user_dir_dir, is a
system directory.  It contains all of the project directories.   It is one of
the six system directories on Multics.  All of the system directories are
contained in the root; they are the only directories contained in the root.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
