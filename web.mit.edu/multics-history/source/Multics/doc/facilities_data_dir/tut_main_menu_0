     You are now in the Multics Tutorial.  Above is a menu whose choices
(usually called menu options) provide information that will enable you to
understand and operate the Multics system.  To select a menu option, type the
number on your keyboard associated with that option.  In the menu above, the
first three options provide an explanation of the topic named and the last
seven produce new menus, from which you can choose explanations of the topics
listed.

     The options in the menu above are arranged in the sequence in which the
subjects are likely to be relevant to you as you begin using Multics.  To get
the most out of the Tutorial, you should read the explanations in the first
three options before proceeding.  Then you may go through the options in the
sequence listed above, or you may wish to choose another order.  Or you may
want to learn about one or two subjects now and come back another time to
learn about the others.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
