     The project directory is the "directory" that contains the "home
directories" of everyone who works on your project.  If you work in Marketing,
your project might be named Mktg on the computer.  In terms of directory
hierarchy, the project directory you work under is directly above your home
directory.  It would appear as follows in a path of directories:

project_directory>home_directory>sub_directory

     To find out the name of the project you're working on, go to command
level by pressing the function key F2.  Once you're there, type the print_wdir
command.  It will print a line of directories such as one of the following:

>user_dir_dir>Pubs>Smith    

or

>user_dir_dir>Mktg>Jones>survey

The project directory is the second one from the left.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
