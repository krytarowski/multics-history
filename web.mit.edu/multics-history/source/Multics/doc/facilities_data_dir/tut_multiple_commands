    More than one "command" and its "arguments" may be placed on a single
"command line." To do this, place a semicolon (;) between the separate command
invocations.  For example:

add_name my_segment my_seg; print my_seg

Here the add_name command adds the name my_seg to the segment named
my_segment.  Then the print command is given this second name when it is
invoked to print the segment.

     No spacing is required between the last argument of one command, the
semicolon, and the name of the next command, but if spaces do appear, it makes
no difference.

     There is no limit to the number of commands you can put on a command line.
In fact, if your command line exceeds the width of your terminal screen, it
will be continued automatically on the next line.  Remember, only a carriage
return ends a command line.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
