02/25/85 meter_rcp

Syntax as a command:  meter_rcp {-control_args}


Function:  prints information about devices controlled by the resource
control package (RCP).


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   displays meters for both locks and devices.
-device STR, -dv STR
   displays meters only for the device named STR.  This control
   argument cannot be used with the -lock or -type control arguments.
-lock
   displays only meters for locks.  The default is to display meter
   information only for devices and not for locks.
-long, -lg
   displays additional information about devices/locks (as selected by
   the other control arguments) that is not otherwise printed (e.g.,
   for -type, an assignment histogram; for -lock, four lines of
   totals).


-report_reset, -rr
   generates a full report and then performs the reset operation.
-reset, -rs
   resets the metering interval for the invoking process so that the
   interval begins at the last call with -reset specified.  If -reset
   has never been given in a process, it is equivalent to having been
   specified at system initialization time.
-type STR, -tp STR
   displays meters only for devices of the type specified by STR.  This
   control argument cannot be used with the -lock or -device control
   arguments.  STR can be tape, disk, console, printer, punch, reader,
   or special.


Notes:  If the meter_rcp command is given with no control arguments, it
prints information for all devices only (no locks).

The following is a brief description of the variables printed if the
-lock control argument is specified.
% time locked
   is the percentage of time spent locked.
% time waiting
   is the percentage of time waiting for locks.
% number of waits
   is the percentage of the number of attempts to lock that required a
   wait.


If the -type control argument is specified, the following variables are
printed for that type only.  This same information is printed for all
device types if no control argument is given, and for the named device
if the -device control argument is given.
Total assignments
   is the number of times the device has been assigned during the
   metering interval.
Total errors
   is the number of I/O transfer errors for the device during the
   metering interval.


Total time assigned
   is the time (in hours, minutes, and seconds) the device has been
   assigned during the metering interval.
% time assigned
   is the percentage of the metering interval that the device has been
   assigned.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
