Syntax as a command:  hc_pf_meters {-control_args}


Function:  prints system-wide statistics concerning page faults taken
on hardcore segments, including those taken on ring-0 stacks.


Control arguments:
-first N, -ft N
   causes the output to be sorted in descending order by number of page
   faults.  Only the first N segments in this sequence are printed.
-report
   prints data accumulated since the last invocation of the command
   with -reset or -report_reset, or since the last bootload (if the
   command has not been invoked with -reset or -report_reset).  This is
   the default.
-report_reset, -rr
   generates a report and then performs the reset operation.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
