Syntax as a command:
   display_log_segment log_segment_ptr {-control_args}


Function: displays the internal information of a log segment.


Arguments:
log_segment_ptr
   is a virtual pointer to the log segment to be displayed.  It must be
   in a format acceptable to cv_ptr_ (this includes log segment
   entrynames and pathnames).  You can supply only a log pointer.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   selects a short form for output.
-header, -he
   displays the log header.  (Default)
-long, -lg
   selects a long form for output.  (Default)
-no_header, -nhe
   does not display the log header.
-no_print, -npr
   does not displays the status and contents of message entries.

-print, -pr
   displays the status and contents of message entries.  The
   information displayed is a superset of that displayed by -trace.
-trace

Notes: This command is meant for analysis purposes.  Log perusal
should be performed with monitor_sys_log, print_sys_log, or
summarize_sys_log.

Use of -no_header, -no_trace, and -no_print together results in no

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
