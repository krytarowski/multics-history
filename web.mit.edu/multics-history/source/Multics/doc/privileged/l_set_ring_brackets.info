03/31/83  l_set_ring_brackets, lsrb

Syntax:  lsrb {path} {optional_args}


Function:  This command modifies the ring brackets of any segment,
including segments whose ring brackets are 1,1,1.  This command
operates on objects whose ring brackets prevent them from being
operated on by the set_ring_brackets command.


Arguments:
path
   is the relative or absolute pathname of a segment whose ring
   brackets are to be modified.
optional_args
  rb1
     is the number to be used as the first ring bracket of the segment.
     (See "Notes" below.)
  rb2
     is the number to be used as the second ring bracket of the
     segment.  (See "Notes" below.)
  rb3
     is the number to be used as the third ring bracket of the segment.
     (See "Notes" below.)


Notes:  Execute access to the installation_tools_ gate is required.

If rb3 is omitted, the third ring bracket is set to rb2.  If rb2
and rb3 are omitted, the ring brackets are set to rb1.  If rb1, rb2,
and rb3 are omitted, they are set to the user's current validation
level.  The ring brackets must be in the allowable range 1 through 7
and must have the ordering:

     rb1 _ rb2 _ rb3

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
