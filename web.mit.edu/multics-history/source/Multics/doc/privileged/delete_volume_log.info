04/04/85 delete_volume_log

Syntax as a command:  delete_volume_log vlname {-control_arg}


Function:  deletes the volume log segment used by the volume backup
subsystem in a way that keeps the other segments used by the volume
backup subsystem consistent.


Arguments:
vlname
   is the name of the volume log.  The volog suffix is assumed if not
   specified.


Control arguments:
-manual_free
   specifies that if deleting is done, volumes are not freed from the
   volume pool automatically; manual freeing is required.  This means
   that dump volumes are deleted from the respective volume logs but
   are not reused until they are marked as free in the volume pool.
   The default is to automatically free volumes in the volume pool.


Notes:  This command should only be used to delete volume log segments
of physical volumes for which neither retrieval nor reloading is
intended in the future.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
