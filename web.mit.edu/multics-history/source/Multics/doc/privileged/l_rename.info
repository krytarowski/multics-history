Syntax:  lren path1 name1 {pathN nameN}


Function:  replaces specified ring 1 segment and multisegment file
names by specified new names without affecting any other names the
entry might have.


Arguments:
path1
   specifies the old name that is to be replaced; it can be a pathname
   or an entryname.  The star convention is allowed.
name1
   specifies the new name that replaces the storage system entryname
   portion of path1.  The equal convention is allowed.


Notes:  Execute access to the installation_tools_ gate is required.

The access mode of the user with respect to the directory specified by
path1 must contain the modify attribute.

Since two entries in a directory cannot have the same entryname,
special action is taken by this command if name1 already exists in the
directory specified by path1.  If the entry having the entryname name1
has an alternate name, entryname name1 is removed and the user is
informed of this action; the renaming operation then takes place.  If
the entry having the entryname name1 has only one name, the entry must
be deleted in order to remove the name.  The user is asked if the
deletion should be done; if the user answers "no," the remaining
operation does not take place.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
