03/31/83  l_add_name, lan

Syntax:  lan path names


Function:  adds alternate name(s) to the existing name(s) of ring 1
segments and multisegment_files.  See the descriptions of the
l_delete_name and l_rename commands.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a segment, multisegment file, directory, or link
   to which an additional name is to be added.
names
   are additional names.  The star convention and the equal convention
   are allowed.


Notes:  Execute access to the installation_tools_ gate is required.

The user must have modify permission on the directory that contains the
entry receiving the additional name.

Two entries in a directory cannot have the same entryname.  Therefore,
special action is taken by this command if the added name already
exists in the directory that contains the path argument.  If the added
name is an alternate name of another entry, the name is removed from
this entry, added to the entry specified by path, and the user is
informed of this action.  If the added name is the only name of another
entry, the user is asked if he wishes to delete this entry.  If he
answers "yes", the entry is deleted and the name is added to the entry
specified by path; if he answers "no", no action is taken.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
