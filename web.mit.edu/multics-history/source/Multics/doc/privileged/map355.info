Syntax as a command:  map355 pathname {-control_args}


Function:  is used to assemble a program written in the FNP assembler
language, map355.  The command does not assemble the program directly.
Instead, it prepares a GCOS job deck to perform the assembly and calls
the GCOS Environment Simulator to do the work.


Arguments:
pathname
   is the pathname of the source program to be assembled.  The suffix
   of map355 need not be given by the user; it is assumed.


Control arguments:
-argument list, -ag list
   specifies a list of arguments to be passed to the GCOS Environment
   Simulator.
-check
   specifies that the compiler only perform a syntax check of the
   source.  No object segment is created.
-comdk
   creates a GCOS comdk segment.  This segment contains a BCD version
   of the source program.  It is created in the working directory with
   a suffix of comdk.
-gcos_list, -gcls
   creates a GCOS listing segment in the working directory.  This is a
   BCD version of the listing segment.  It has a suffix of glist.


-list, -ls
   creates a listing segment that documents the compilation.  The
   listing is created in the working directory, and has a suffix of
   list.
-macro_file path
   specifies the pathname of the macro file to be used for the
   assembly.  If omitted, >ldd>comm>fnp>info>355_macros is used.
-noconvert
   specifies that the input segment is a GCOS comdk, rather than an
   ASCII segment.  If this control argument is used, the source segment
   must have a suffix of comdk.


Notes:  This command creates a series of segments for use by the GCOS
simulator.  Some are created in the working directory, some are created
in the process directory, and some through links in the working
directory to the process directory.  These segments and links are
normally deleted when the command terminates, leaving just the object
segment, which has a suffix of objdk.

Refer to the GCOS Environment Simulator manual, Order No.  AN05, for
more information on the use of the GCOS Environment Simulator.


The map355 command creates links in the working directory to segments
to be placed in the process directory.  If the process terminates in
the middle of a compilation (new_proc or a crash), these links will
remain.  This means that the next time the command is invoked, it will
fail because the links point to a nonexistent directory.  Even though
the command fails, the bad links will be unlinked and subsequent
invocations will work correctly.


List of severity values:  The map355 command sets the following
severity values to be returned by the severity active function when the
"map355" keyword is used:

      Value     Meaning

        0       No error (or command not yet used)
        1       The assembly produced warning flags
        2       The objdk segment could not be created

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
