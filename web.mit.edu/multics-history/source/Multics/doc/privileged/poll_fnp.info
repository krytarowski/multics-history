03/27/85 poll_fnp

Syntax as a command:  poll_fnp {fnp_list} {-control_args}


Function:  initiates and controls automatic polling of FNPs.  Polling
consists of reading error statistics from the FNP memory and logging
them in either the syserr log or a file.  This command sets up timers
and event call handlers within the process.  Once initiated, FNP
polling is performed periodically, independent of whatever else is
going on in the process.  This command is normally used by the
initializer or a daemon.


Arguments:
fnp_list
   is a list of the FNP names to be polled.  If no names are listed,
   all FNPs are polled.


Control arguments:
-debug, db
   prints extra debugging information each time polling is performed.
-log
   writes statistical information to the syserr log.  This is the
   default.  Access to the hphcs_ gate is required.
-output_file path, -of path
   writes statistical information to the segment specified by path.
   This control argument can be used in conjunction with -log.
-time N, -tm N
   specifies the polling interval in minutes.  The default polling
   interval is 15 minutes.


   The following control arguments modify the polling already in
   process and cannot be used on the initial invocation of the poll_fnp
   command.
-stop, -sp
   stops polling for the FNPs specified with the fnp_list argument.  If
   no FNPs have been specified, polling of all FNPs is stopped.
   Polling continues to be scheduled periodically, even though no FNPs
   are being polled.
-start, -sr
   resumes polling for the FNPs specified with the fnp_list argument.
   If no FNPs have been specified, polling of all FNPs is resumed.
   Note that the next polling does not occur immediately; it is
   performed during the next scheduled polling cycle.


-finish
   schedules the last polling cycle immediately.  Once this cycle
   completes, polling is disabled, and a new poll_fnp command is
   required to start it again.  To stop polling without performing one
   last cycle, use both -stop and -finish.


Notes:  If polling of an individual FNP fails three consecutive times,
polling of that FNP is stopped.  If three consecutive scheduled polling
cycles are missed because a previous cycle did not complete, an
automatic finish operation is performed, and no further cycles are
scheduled.

Polling of FNPs has no effect on the users of devices connected to the
FNP.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
