03/26/85 fnp_data_summary

Syntax as a command:  fnp_data_summary {fnp_names} {-control_args}


Function:  reports error statistics recorded in the syserr log by the
poll_fnp command.  The statistics reported include parity errors for
all channels and various counters for synchronous channels whose
interpretation depends on the line type of the channel.  Only nonzero
statistics are reported.


Arguments:
fnp_names
   are the names of FNPs for which statistics are to be reported.  If
   no fnp_names are specified, statistics are reported for all FNPs for
   which any nonzero statistics are available.


Control arguments:
-expand
   displays in expanded form every entry in the syserr log containing
   statistics for the specified FNP(s).
-extend, -ext
   appends the output of the command to the end of the output_file if
   it already exists.  This control argument can be specified only if
   -output_file (below) is specified.
-for TIME
   restricts the scan of the syserr log to an interval of length TIME,
   where TIME is a character string representation of a time interval
   in a form acceptable to convert_date_to_binary_ (described in the
   Multics Subroutines and I/O Modules manual, Order No.  AG93).  This
   control argument is incompatible with -to (described below).  The
   default is to continue the scan up to the end of the log.


-from DATE_TIME, -fm DATE_TIME
   starts scanning the syserr log from the time specified by DATE_TIME,
   which must be a character string acceptable to
   convert_date_to_binary_ (described in the Multics Subroutines and
   I/O Modules manual, Order No.  AG93).  The default is to start at
   the beginning of the log.
-output_file {PATH}, -of {PATH}
   directs output to a file.  If PATH is specified, it is the pathname
   of the output file; otherwise, output is sent to
   fnp_data_summary.output in the current working directory.  If
   -output_file is not specified, the default is to direct output to
   your terminal.


-to DATE_TIME
   ends the scan of the syserr log at the time specified by DATE_TIME,
   which must be a character string acceptable to
   convert_date_to_binary_.  This control argument is incompatible with
   -for (above).  The default is to continue the scan to the end of the
   log.


Access required:  Read permission is required on the log segments
themselves and status permission is required on their containing
directories.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
