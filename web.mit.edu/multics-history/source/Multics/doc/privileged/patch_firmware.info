03/27/85 patch_firmware

Syntax as a command:  patch_firmware path mem addr
   word1...word2...wordi


Function:  patches a segment containing an image of a firmware module
for an MPC.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the segment containing the firmware.
mem
   is the memory overlay to patch.  This argument can be cs to patch
   the control store overlay, or rw to patch the read/write memory
   overlay.
addr
   is the starting address to patch, in hexadecimal.
wordi
   is a new MPC word, in hexadecimal.  All wordi arguments must be in
   the range 0-FFFF.  At least one wordi argument must be specified.
   Up to 16 words can be patched with one patch_firmware command.


Notes:  The patch_firmware command displays the old and new contents of
each firmware word patched, as well as the checksum, before the patch
is made.  The user is then asked whether the patch is correct.  The
patch is not made unless you answer yes.

Firmware modules can be retrieved from the IFAD tape using the
load_tandd_library command (described in the Multics Online Test and
Diagnostics Manual, Order No.  AU77).  Normally, firmware modules are
kept in the sequential file >system_library_tandd>tandd_deckfile.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
