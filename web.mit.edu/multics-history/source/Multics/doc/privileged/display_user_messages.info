-no_octal, -noc
   does not include an octal dump of the message in the display.
   (Default)
-octal, -oc
   prints detailed information about selected entries, including an
   octal dump of the message.


-source GROUP_ID, -sc GROUP_ID
   selects entries sent by a process matching GROUP_ID.  In general,
   the Initializer is the primary source of user messages.  See Notes
   below for the format of GROUP_ID.
-source_id PROCESS_ID,
-scid PROCESS_ID,
-sid PROCESS_ID
   selects entries sent by the process having the given octal
   PROCESS_ID.
-target GROUP_ID, -tgt GROUP_ID
   selects entries sent to a process matching GROUP_ID.  See Notes
   below for the format of GROUP_ID.


-target_id PROCESS_ID,
-tgtid PROCESS_ID, -tid PROCESS_ID,
-process_id PROCESS_ID,
-pid PROCESS_ID
   selects entries sent to the process having the given octal
   PROCESS_ID.


Access required:  Access to the user_message_admin_ gate is required to
use this command.


Notes:  All entries are displayed if no selection arguments are given.

The -source and -target GROUP_ID operand is given in one of the
following formats:

          person_id.project_id.tag
          person_id.project_id
          person_id

where any of the components can be omitted or given as an asterisk (*)
to match all values in that component position.


Examples:

The following example shows the tabular form of brief output.

! dum

  SOURCE       TARGET  MESSAGE
  Initializer  GDixon  system message: AS warning
  Initializer  GDixon  com channel info

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
