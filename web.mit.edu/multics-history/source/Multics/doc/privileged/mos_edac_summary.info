03/27/85 mos_edac_summary

Syntax as a command:  mos_edac_summary {-control_args}


Function:  scans the syserr log and summarizes MOS EDAC activity in a
brief report.


Control arguments:
-day_limit N
   sets a threshold of N days that a memory chip can fail before
   including it in the summary.  The maximum value for N is 16.
-for T
   specifies a relative time (such as "1 hour") used to compute the
   ending time from the starting time.
-from DT, -fm DT
   specifies the date/time to start scanning the log.
-limit N
   sets a threshold of N EDAC errors for a memory chip before including
   it in the summary.


-mem list
   specifies a list of memories for which information is required
   (i.e., mem a b c).
-to D
   specifies the date/time to stop scanning the log.


Access required:  Read permission is required on the log segments
themselves and status permission is required on their containing
directories.


Notes:  If -from DT is not specified, the scan starts with the earliest
message in the syserr log.  The ending time may be specified by using
-for or -to, but not both.  If both are omitted, the scan terminates
with the last message in the log.  All dates and times must be in a
format acceptable to the convert_date_to_binary_ subroutine, described
in the Multics Subroutines and I/O Modules manual, Order No.  AG93.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
