02/26/85 move_dir_quota

Syntax as a command:  move_dir_quota path1 quota_change1 ...  {pathN
quota_changeN}


Function:  allows a user to move records of directory quota between two
directories, one immediately inferior to the other.


Arguments:
pathi
   is the pathname of a directory.  The quota change takes place
   between this directory and its containing directory.  A pathi of -wd
   or -wdir specifies the working directory.  The star convention
   cannot be used.
quota_changei
   is the number of records to be subtracted from the containing
   directory's directory quota and added to the directory quota on
   pathi.  If this number is negative, records are added to the
   containing directory's directory quota and subtracted from the
   directory quota on pathi.


Access required:  The user must have modify permission on both the
directory specified by pathi and its containing directory.


Notes:  After the change, the directory quota must be greater than or
equal to the number of records used by directories in pathi unless the
change would make the quota zero.

If the change would make the directory quota on pathi zero, there must
be no immediately inferior directory with nonzero quota.  When the
directory quota is changed to zero, the records used and the
time-record product for pathi is reflected up to the superior
directory.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
