03/31/83  l_names


This command is intended to be a tool for those users who update the system
libraries.  Users must have access to the gate segment
installation_tools_.


Entry points in l_names:
   (List is generated by the help command)


:Entry:  move:  03/16/83 l_names$move


This entry moves all the extra names from one multiple-named directory
entry to another for any number of entry pairs.  The name used to
designate the segment is not moved; all others are moved.


Syntax:
l_names$move from_path_ to_path_ ...  from_path_ to_path_


Arguments:
from_path_
   is the pathname of the segment whose names are to be moved.
to_path_
   is the pathname of the segment to which names are to be moved.


:Entry:  copy:  03/16/83 l_names$copy


This entry is similar to l_names$move but leaves the names on the
segment that originally has them.  Note that in this case the names
cannot be copied to a segment in the same directory because that would
attempt to duplicate names in the directory.  All of the names on the
original segment are copied.


Syntax:
names$copy {from_path_ to_path_ ...  from_path_ to_path_}


Arguments:
from_path_
   is the pathname of the segment whose names are to be copied.
to_path_
   is the pathname of the segment to which names are to be copied.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
