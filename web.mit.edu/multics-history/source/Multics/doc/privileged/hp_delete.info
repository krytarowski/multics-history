02/08/85  hp_delete, hpdl

Syntax as a command:  hpdl path


Function:  deletes segments or directories (including their inferior
directories, segments, and links (if accessible)) which cannot be
deleted by the delete or delete_dir commands due to connection failures
or other problems resulting from volume deregistration or the failure
of emergency shutdown.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the segment or directory to be deleted.  The star
   convention may not be used.


Access required:  The hp_delete command requires access to the
highly-privileged hphcs_ gate.  Access to the system_privilege_ gate is
required as well.  All discretionary (ACL) and nondiscretionary (AIM)
access control is observed by this command.  The segment or directory
to be deleted may, however, have a lower ring bracket than the user's
current validation level.


Notes:  The deletion is not logged in the syserr log.

The user is queried once before performing the deletion.

Out-of-service directories may be deleted.

The segment safety switch is ignored.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
