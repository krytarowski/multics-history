02/27/85 remove_registry

Syntax as a command:  remove_registry paths


Function:  remove RCP Resource Management registries from service.
This command should only be used in exceptional circumstances.  (See
"Notes" below.)


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a registry to be removed from service.  The star
   convention is accepted.  If the suffix rcpr is not given, it is
   assumed.


Notes:  When a registry is removed, its suffix is changed from rcpr to
old.

The activity of removing registries is normally reserved to the
Initializer process, which will automatically remove a registry when a
new RTDT is installed that no longer contains an entry for the resource
type associated with that registry.  In general, manual removal of
registries is only necessary in the process of recovery from a
catastrophic system failure and reload, where the existing registries
and the existing RTDT may be out of agreement.  Manual removal of
registries at other times can result in unrecoverable errors by RCP
Resource Management.


Access required:  This command requires access to the rcp_sys_ gate.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
