05/28/86 salvage_dir

Syntax as a command:  salvage_dir dir_path {output_path} {-control_args}


Function:  verifies and/or rebuilds one directory.  This command is
issued from ring 4 only.

The command "x repair" causes one or more daemons to be logged in to
perform an online salvage using the salvage_dir command.  That is the
recommended way of performing an online salvage.


Arguments:
dir_path
   is the pathname of the directory being salvaged.
output_path
   is the pathname of the segment or multisegment file to which the
   salvager messages should be appended.  If the segment does not
   exist, it is created.  If not specified, output goes to user_output.


Control arguments:
-check_vtoce
   causes VTOC entry checking for all branches in the directory.  These
   checks cause the permanent information in the VTOC entry to be
   updated.  It also causes connection failures to be detected.
-compact
   specifies rebuilding of the directory if one or more pages are
   recovered.


-delete_connection_failure, -dcf
   deletes branches for segments that do not have corresponding VTOC
   entries.  The default is to not delete such branches.  This control
   argument causes permanent VTOC entry information to be updated.  Use
   of this argument causes subsequent volume retrieval of the lost data
   more expensive, because both the data and the branch must be
   recovered.
-rebuild
   forces rebuild of the directory.


List of additional arguments:
The following control arguments are available, but are used for
software debugging:
-debug, -db
   causes additional trace information to be printed.  Because this
   information includes offsets in the original directory, the -dump
   option should also be used.
-dump path
   specifies that a copy of the directory should be placed in a segment
   in the directory specified by the pathname path.  The copy is only
   created when certain error conditions are detected during salvage.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
