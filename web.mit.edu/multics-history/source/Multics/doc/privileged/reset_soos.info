Syntax as a command:  reset_soos path


Function:  resets the security-out-of-service switch for the specified
directory or segment after verifying that it is consistent with respect to
AIM access controls.

The reset_soos command is needed only if the site is using the AIM
access controls.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the directory or segment that is to be put back
   into service.


Access required:  The user must have access to the
system_privilege_ gate to use this command.


Notes:  This command fails and prints an error message if the
directory:

1. is upgraded without terminal quota;

2. contains segments with an access class unequal to the containing
   directory;

3. contains directories with an access class that is not greater than
   or equal to the containing directory; or

4. contains inconsistent upgraded directories or ring 1 system
   segments.

This command fails and prints an error message if the segment
has an access class unequal to the containing directory.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
