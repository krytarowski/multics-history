02/25/85  meter_gate, mg

Syntax as a command:  mg STR {entry_nm} {-control_arg}


Function:  is used to interpret and print per-system metering
information for entries in specified hardcore gates.


Arguments:
STR
   is the name of the gate segment to be examined; i.e., hcs_, phcs_,
   hphcs_, ioi_, hc_backup_, etc.
entry_nm
   is the name of a single entry in the specified gate.  Only the
   information for that entry is printed.  If entry_nm is not
   specified, information for all entries is printed.  No control
   argument can be given if an entry_nm is specified.


Control arguments:
-average, -av
   sorts the output on the average time spent in each entry.
-call, -cl
   sorts the output on total calls to each entry.
-page, -pg
   sorts the output on the average number of page faults in each entry.
-reset, -rs
   resets the metering interval for the invoking process so that the
   interval begins at the last call with -reset specified.  If -reset
   has never been given in a process, it is equivalent to having been
   specified at system initialization time.
-time, -tm
   sorts the output on the total time spent in each entry.


Notes:  If the meter_gate command is given with no control argument, it
does not sort the output.

The output header consists of the time the system was brought up, the
current time, and the total charge time (which equals total_cpu_time
minus idle_time).  Also printed is the total number of calls to the
gate, the amount of time spent in the entries that were called, and the
percentage of total charged time that was spent in the entries that
were called.


Metering information is collected only for gate segments defined with
the "hgate" macro, and only for those entries in the segment defined
with the "gate" macro (refer to the gate_macros.incl.alm include file
for these macros, and refer to the source listing of a particular gate
to apply this principle).  For example, some hardcore gate entries are
defined with the "fgate" macro for efficiency or because ring 0 stack
history is abandoned during the call (e.g., hcs_$block); such gate
entries are not metered.

The following is a brief description of the variables printed out by
the meter_gate command.
calls
   is the total number of times the gate entry point was called.


pcnt
   is the percentage of total charge time spent in the called segment.
avg
   is the average virtual time in milliseconds spent in the called
   segment.
pfault
   is the average number of page faults incurred during a call to a
   segment through the specified entry.
entry name
   is the name of an entry point to the gate.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
