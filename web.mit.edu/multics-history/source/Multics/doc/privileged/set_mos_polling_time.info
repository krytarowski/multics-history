03/27/85 set_mos_polling_time

Syntax as a command:  set_mos_polling_time {N}


Function:  sets the time interval used by the system for polling MOS
memories to check for and log EDAC errors.


Arguments:
N
   is a decimal integer representing the time in minutes between MOS
   memory polls.  If omitted, the command prints the current polling
   interval.  If N is 0, MOS memory polling is disabled.


Access required:  You must have re access to hphcs_ to use this
command.


Notes:  MOS memory polling is disabled when the system is initialized.
This command must be used to enable it.

MOS memory polling should not be enabled on systems that have core
memories unless the TEST/NORMAL switch on the maintenance panel of the
memory (not controller) is set to TEST.  If this switch is set to
NORMAL, spurious errors may be logged for the memory.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
