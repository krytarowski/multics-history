02/26/85 priv_move_quota

Syntax as a command:  priv_move_quota path1 quota_change1 {...  pathN
quota_changeN}


Function:  moves records of quota between two directories (one
immediately inferior to the other) regardless of the authorization of
the process.

This command is identical to the standard move_quota command except
that directory system privileges are turned on while quota is being
moved.  The priv_move_quota command is needed only if the site is using
the AIM access controls.


Arguments:
pathi
   is the pathname of a directory branch.  The quota change takes place
   between this branch and its containing directory.  The working
   directory may be specified by -wd.  The star convention may not be
   used.
quota_changei
   is the number of storage records to be subtracted from the
   containing directory quota and added to the quota on pathi.  If this
   number is negative, the number of records is added to the containing
   directory quota and subtracted from the quota on pathi.


Access required:  The user must have "re" access to system_privilege_
gate and must have modify permission specified on the ACL of both pathi
and its containing directory.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
