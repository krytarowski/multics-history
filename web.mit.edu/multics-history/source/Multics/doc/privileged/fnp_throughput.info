02/07/85 fnp_throughput

Syntax as a command:  fnp_throughput {fnp_id} {-control_arg}


Function:  reports character throughput for an FNP or all FNPs and
optionally allows the resetting of the metering interval.


Arguments:
fnp_id
   is the name of an FNP or "*", which means all currently running
   FNPs.  This argument must be specified unless the -reset control
   argument is specified, in which case fnp_id must not be specified.


Control arguments:  may be either, but not both, of the following.  If
neither is specified, information is printed and the metering interval
is not reset.
-report_reset, rr
   causes statistics to be printed and the metering interval to be
   reset.  If this control argument is specified, fnp_id must be
   specified.
-reset, -rs
   causes the metering interval to be reset without printing any
   statistics.  If this control argument is specified, fnp_id must be
   omitted.


Notes:  The start of the metering interval in effect is measured from
the time the FNP was last booted, or from the time the interval was
last reset, whichever was the most recent event.

The reset action of the -report_reset control argument applies to the
metering interval for all FNPs, even though the command invocation is
specific to the statistics for a particular FNP.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
