01/13/87  copy_mst


Syntax as a command:  copy_mst input_spec output_spec {-control_args}


Function:  copies a Multics System Tape or an MST image stored in a
file into another tape or file.


Arguments:
input_spec
   can be either the -input_volume or -input_file control argument, or
   the reel identification number of a Multics System TAPE from which
   information is to be copied.  The reel identification number, which
   is site dependent, can be up to 32 characters long.
output_spec
   can be either the -output_volume or -output_file control argument,
   or the reel identifier number of the tape onto which the copy is to
   be made.


Control arguments:
-input_volume volname, -ivol volname
   gives the input tape volume name of the MST to be copied.
-input_file path, -if path
   gives the pathname of a file containing the MST image to be copied.
   This file must have been previously created by generate_mst or
   copy_mst.
-output_volume volname, -ovol volname
   gives the output tape volume name.
-output_file path, -of path
   gives the pathname of the file into which the MST image is to be
   copied.


-density DEN, -den DEN
   gives a tape density.  This control argument applies to the previous
   -input_volume or -output_volume control argument.  DEN may be 800,
   1600 or 6250.  If given for input tapes, the tapes are mounted on a
   tape drive capable of reading density DEN.  However, the actual
   density at which the input tapes are written determines the density
   used for reading.  If given for output tapes, the tapes are written
   at density DEN.  The default density is 1600 BPI (bits per inch).


Notes:  The message "Tape tape_id1 does not end in a collection mark"
is normal for BOS tapes.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
