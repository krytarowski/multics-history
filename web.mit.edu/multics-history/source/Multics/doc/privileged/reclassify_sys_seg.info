02/27/85 reclassify_sys_seg

Syntax as a command:  reclassify_sys_seg path {access_class}


Function:  changes the access class of a ring 1 system segment or
converts a ring 1 normal segment to/from a system segment.  A ring 1
system segment is a segment whose access class is greater than that of
its containing directory, e.g., message segments such as those used for
daemon queues and user mailboxes; a ring 1 normal segment is a segment
whose access class is equal to that of its containing directory.

The reclassify_sys_seg command is needed only if the site is using the
AIM access controls.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the segment to be reclassified.
access_class
   is the access class (sensitivity level and category) to be assigned
   to the segment.  Use the print_auth_names command for a list of
   valid access class values.  See the Multics Programmer's Reference
   manual, Order No.  AG91, for a detailed discussion of the AIM
   mechanism.


Access required:  The user must have access to the
system_privilege_gate to use the command.  Additionally, the user must
have modify permission specified on the acl of the containing
directory.  However, the reclassification is performed without checking
the validation level of the process.  Therefore, reclassification of
ring 1 segments may be performed from the user ring.


Notes:  If the segment is to become a normal segment, the access_class
argument must be omitted.  A specified access_class argument must be
greater than the access_class of the containing directory.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
