02/28/85 sweep_pv

Syntax as a command:  sweep_pv pvname {-control_args}


Function:  performs utility functions that require walking through the
VTOC of a mounted physical volume.  Among these functions are the
listing of contents and unconnected VTOCEs, the deletion of such
VTOCEs, and the evacuation of physical volumes (for logical volume
compression).  The volume is processed in VTOC order.


Arguments:
pvname
   is the name of the mounted physical volume whose VTOC is to be
   walked through.


Control arguments:
-adopt
   attempts to reconstruct directory branches for VTOCEs encountering
   reverse connection failures.  Unique names are derived from the
   primary name in the VTOCE.  The -gc control argument must be given
   to use the -adopt control argument.  If the -dl control argument is
   given as well, VTOCEs that cannot be adopted are deleted.  The
   success or failure of adoptions is reported to the report produced
   by the -gc control argument.  For a description of the definition
   attributes provided for adopted branches, see the description of the
   adopt_seg command.  This request requires hc_backup_ access.
-debug, -db
   is for system programmer use, and disables highly privileged calls
   in order to allow debugging of this program.


-delete, -dl
   deletes unconnected VTOCEs.  This control argument is only allowed
   when the -gc control argument is specified.  Access to hphcs_ is
   required to use this control argument.  The collection report is
   modified to indicate that these VTOCEs were deleted.
-force, -fc
   forces access to all directories that need to be scanned where
   status permission is lacking.  Status permission is necessary for
   all components of the pathnames of VTOCEs processed.  If this
   control argument is not used, or status permission is lacking and
   cannot be forced, an error is reported.
-from first
   indicates the first VTOCE to be processed.  If first is not given,
   VTOCEs are processed starting at VTOC index 0.


-gc
   performs garbage collection, i.e., all VTOCEs for which a reverse
   connection failure is encountered in resolving their pathnames are
   logged in a collection file.  This file is produced whether or not
   the -list control argument, above, is specified.  At the end of the
   collection file report, the total number of VTOCEs and records held
   by them in this state is printed.  Selected information, such as the
   name in the VTOCE and date/time used and modified, is also put in
   the report for each such VTOCE.  The collection file report is given
   a three-component name and is placed in the working directory.  The
   three-component name has "pvgc" as the first component, the physical
   volume name as the second, and the time the segment is created as
   the third component (e.g., pvgc.public.0814).


-list
   creates a listing file containing the VTOC index, time listed, and
   pathname of every segment on the volume at the time its VTOCE is
   scanned.  An asterisk on the line of the listing for a particular
   VTOCE indicates a reverse connection failure (i.e., no branch exists
   for the entry).  For nondirectory segments, the page fault meter of
   the segment is given.  The convention for listing incomplete
   pathnames is the same as that used by the vtoc_pathname command (see
   the vtoc_pathname description in the Multics Commands and Active
   Functions manual, Order No.  AG92).  The listing file is given a
   three-component name and is placed in the working directory.  The
   three-component name has "pvlist" as the first component, the
   physical volume name as the second, and the time the segment is
   created as the third component (e.g., pvlist.public.0749).


-move, -mv
   moves all segments corresponding to VTOCEs processed off this volume
   onto another physical volume of the same logical volume.  Segments
   that suffer reverse connection failures are not moved.  If segments
   are moved for some purpose other than evacuation, the inhibit_pv
   command should be invoked with the -off control argument after
   moving has taken place.  The sweep_pv command attempts to target
   segment moves to the physical volume in the logical volume with the
   most page space available by inhibiting and disinhibiting volumes
   dynamically; all volumes except the volume being evacuated are
   disinhibited when the sweep_pv command is exited.  Volumes found to
   be inhibited at the time the command is invoked are not
   disinhibited; this facilitates simultaneous evacuation of volumes.
   Any volume that is completely evacuated by this means should be
   deregistered before the logical volume is reaccepted.  Access to the
   hphcs_ gate is required to use this control argument.  (See the
   Multics System Maintenance Procedures manual, Order No.  AM81, for
   more details.)


-only vtocx
   processes only the single VTOCE whose octal index is vtocx.
-to last
   indicates last VTOCE to be processed.  If last is not given,
   processing proceeds to the end of the VTOC.


Access required:  The sweep_pv command requires phcs_ access, access to
hc_backup_ if the -adopt control argument is used, and access to hphcs_
if the -delete or -move control arguments are used.


Notes:  Any errors encountered during the VTOC sweep are reported to a
file that is given a three-component name and placed in the working
directory.  The three-component name has "pvef" as the first component,
the physical volume name as the second, and the time the segment is
created as the third component (e.g., pvef.public.1321).  Errors in
command usage, such as specifying a nonexistent or unmounted physical
volume, are reported to the bootload console.

When sweep_pv is invoked with the -move control argument, it first
inhibits segment creation on the volume being vacated, and then vacates
the pack.  When sweep_pv terminates, it leaves the volume inhibited and
prints a message to this effect.  The volume can be uninhibited
manually by means of the inhibit_pv command.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
