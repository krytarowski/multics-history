02/25/85 meter_fnp_idle

Syntax as a command:  meter_fnp_idle fnp_name {-control-args}


Function:  reads FNP idle metering information at specified intervals
and stores the information in a segment for later viewing through the
display_fnp_idle command.


Arguments:
fnp_name
   identifies the FNP for which idle time is to be recorded.


Control arguments:
-directory path, -dr path
   specifies that the segments in which idle time information is to be
   stored are to be created in the directory with pathname path.  The
   default is the user's working directory.  Segment names are of the
   form fnp_idle_data.F.MMDDYY.HHMMSS.I where F is fnp_name,
   MMDDYY.HHMMSS is the starting date and time of recording, and I is
   the specified interval in minutes.
-interval N
   specifies that metering information is to be sampled every N
   minutes.  The default is 1.
-stop, -sp
   terminates meter reading on this FNP.  No other control argument may
   be specified with -stop.


Access required:  Use of this command requires access either to the
metering_gate gate or the phcs_ gate.


Notes:  Information is appended to the idle time segment until the
-stop control argument is encountered or the process terminates.
Maximum length of an idle time segment is 64K (to avoid exhausting a
256K ASTE).  If a segment becomes full, a new one is created.  On
average, taking readings at one-minute intervals would fill a 64K
segment in a little over three weeks (if a single process in which the
command was invoked were to run that long).

Each invocation of the command creates a new segment.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
