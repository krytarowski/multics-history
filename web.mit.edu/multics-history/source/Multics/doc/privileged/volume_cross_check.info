04/05/85 volume_cross_check

Syntax as a command:  volume_cross_check dvname {-control_args}


Function:  checks the validity of the various volume backup databases.
Where it detects inconsistent information it corrects and rebuilds the
databases.  The cross-checking is performed using the volume pool, and
the various volume logs.


Arguments:
dvname
   is the name of the dump volume.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   specifies brief output.
-long, -lg
   specifies long output.
-working_dir, -wd
   searches the working directory for volume logs and the
   Volume_Dumper.volumes volume pool; searches the directory
   [wd]>contents for the contents segment and the contents names
   segment; searches the directory [wd]>pvolog for the physical volume
   log.  If this control argument is not given, the default system
   directories are searched.


Notes:  To cross-check all the volumes in use by the volume backup
system, issue the following command sequence:

      manage_volume_pool u >ddd>volume_backup>Volume_Dumper
      volume_cross_check ([manage_volume_pool l -names])

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
