04/05/85 merge_volume_log

Syntax as a command:  merge_volume_log vlname1 vlname2 {vlname3}


Function:  merges the contents of two volume logs that describe the
same physical volume.  It should only be used to merge the segment
produced by a recover_volume_log operation with the volume log already
in existence.


Arguments:
vlname1
   is the pathname of the old volume log.  After vlname1 and vlname2
   are combined, the merged copy is given the name of the old volume
   log (vlname1), unless the optional argument vlname3 is specified.
vlname2
   is the pathname of the new volume log.
vlname3
   is the pathname of the resultant merged volume log.


Notes:  The suffix volog is assumed for all vlnames, if not specified.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
