03/31/83  library_descriptor_compiler, ldc

Syntax:  ldc desc_name {-control_arg}


Function:  compiles a library description to produce a library
descriptor data segment.

Refer to "Library Description Language" in the Multics Library
Maintenance (AN80) manual for a discussion of the syntax and semantics
of the library description language.


Arguments:
desc_name
   is the relative pathname of the segment containing the library
   description to be compiled.  If this pathname does not end with an
   ld suffix, then one is assumed.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   indicates that the brief form of error messages is to be used for
   all errors diagnosed during the compilation.  (See "Notes" below.)
-long, -lg
   indicates that the long form of error messages is to be used for all
   errors diagnosed during the compilation.  (See "Notes" below.)


Notes:  If the segment being compiled is called descriptor_name.ld,
then the compilation generates a segment called descriptor_name.alm in
the working directory.  This segment can be assembled by the alm
command to produce the library descriptor data segment.

If neither -brief nor -long is used, then the long form of error
messages is used for the first occurrence of an error, and the brief
form is used for subsequent occurrences of that error.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
