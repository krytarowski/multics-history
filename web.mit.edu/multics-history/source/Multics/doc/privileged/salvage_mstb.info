02/27/85 salvage_mstb

Syntax as a command:  salvage_mstb path {N}


Function:  rebuilds an overloaded MSTB (PNT or URF), or recovers the
contents of a damaged MSTB.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the MSTB to be recovered.
N
   is the number of entries to make in the new table.  The default is
   three times the number of used entries in the old table, making the
   new MSTB 33% full.


Notes:  The PNT can only be salvaged by ring 1 process.  After
salvaging, and before any further logins, the system must be brought
down and then brought back up.

The URF can be salvaged whenever it is not in use by any process.

Entries in an MSTB are accessed using a hashing algorithm.  For most
efficient operation, it is recommended that the PNT be kept between 30%
and 50% full and the URF between 50% and 70% full.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
