02/27/85 set_system_search_rules

Syntax as a command:  set_system_search_rules path


Function:  is a highly privileged command used in the initializer
process to set the site's default search rules for all processes.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a default search rules segment (described below)
   created earlier by the system administrator.


Notes on default search rules segment:  Each line in the default
search rules segment may be either a keyword or the absolute pathname
of a directory to be searched.  The order of the lines in the default
search rules segment gives the order in which the rules are applied by
a user process.

The valid keywords are listed below.

      initiated_segments
      referencing_dir
      working_dir
      home_dir
      process_dir


The absolute pathname search rules and the keywords may be followed by
one or more tags.  Tags are single word identifiers chosen by the
system administrator and used to categorize search rules into groups.
They are spearated from pathname or keyword search rules by a comma.


The user can find out the site-defined tags by issuing the
get_system_search_rules command (described in the Multics Commands and
Active Functions manual, Order No.  AG92).  For example, if the
get_system_search_rules command returns the following

      initiated_segments,default,fast
      referencing_dir,default,fast
      working_dir,default,fast
      >system_library_standard,default,fast,system_libraries
      >system_library_unbundled,default,fast,system_libraries
      >system_library_tools,default,system_libraries
      >system_library_auth_maint,default,system_libraries


the user knows there are three tags he can specify in his search rules,
default, fast, and system_libraries.  For convenience, the user can use
these tags in his own search rules rather than specify the entire list
of directories and keywords containing these tags.  For example, the
system_libraries tag in the user's search rules expands to

      >system_library_standard
      >system_library_unbundled
      >system_library_tools
      >system_library_auth_maint

The order of the expanded list is the same as the order of the
directories in the default search rule segment.  Recursion is not
allowed.


Up to 10 tags and up to 50 search rules may be specified in the default
search rules segment.

A user process may specify up to 22 search rules.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
