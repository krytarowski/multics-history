02/21/85  interrupt_meters, intm

Syntax as a command:  intm {-control_args}


Function:  prints out metering information for input/output multiplexer
(IOM) channel interrupts.


Control arguments:
-channel N
   prints out interrupt metering information only for IOM channel N.
-iom N
   prints out interrupt metering information only for those channels on
   IOM N.
-report_reset, -rr
   generates a full report and then performs the reset operation.


-reset, -rs
   resets the metering interval for the invoking process so that the
   interval begins at the last call with -reset specified.  If -reset
   has never been given in a process, it is equivalent to having been
   specified at system initialization time.
-total, -tt
   prints out only the total IOM and nonIOM interrupt metering
   information.


Access required:  This command requires access to phcs_ or
metering_gate_.


Notes:  If the interrupt_meters command is given with no control
arguments, it prints a full report.

The following are brief descriptions of the metering information
printed out by interrupt_meters.
Int
   is the number of interrupts which occurred.
Avg Time
   is the average time (in milliseconds) needed to handle each
   interrupt.
% CPU
   is the percentage of total CPU time needed to handle the interrupts.
Name
   is the name of the device on the channel.


The following are descriptions of the totals printed by
interrupt_meters.
Chan
   is the total of all IOM channel interrupts.  The times printed are
   based on the total time spent in the per-channel interrupt handlers.
Other
   is the total of all IOM interrupts.  Each IOM interrupt may cause
   the handling of several channel interrupts.  The times printed
   include only that time in the common interrupt path and exclude time
   spent in the per-channel handlers.
Total
   is the total of all interrupts handled by the system.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
