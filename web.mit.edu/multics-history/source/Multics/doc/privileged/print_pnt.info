02/26/85 print_pnt

Syntax as a command:  print_pnt {Person_id} {-control_args}


Function:  prints the contents of a binary person name table (PNT) in a
readable form on the administrator's terminal.  Note that, while
portions of the user entry in the PNT are stored in encrypted form, any
encryption algorithm is susceptible to a sophisticated,
computer-assisted code-breaking effort.  Therefore the System
Administrator should ensure that access to the PNT is as restricted as
possible.  In general, only the SysAdmin and SysDaemon projects should
have access to the PNT.


Arguments:
Person_id
   specifies the person whose PNT entry is to be printed.  If this
   argument is omitted, the entire PNT is printed.


Control arguments:
-brief
   makes no attempt to access information in the user registration file
   (URF).
-force_no_password_info
   same as -no_password_info, but additionally causes the rejection of
   the -password_info control argument for this invocation of
   print_pnt.  This control argument can be used to ensure that limited
   system administrators cannot obtain password information.


-no_password_info
   suppresses the display of information about good or bad passwords
   and the date of password change.  The rest of the PNT/URF entry is
   displayed.
-password_info
   displays any information about good or bad passwords and the date of
   password change with the rest of the PNT/URF entry.  (Default)

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
