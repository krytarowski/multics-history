07/16/87 copy_liveproc

Syntax:  copy_liveproc process_dir_name user_name {-control_args}


Function: sets up a process directory for a running (or hung) process
in preparation for use by the analyze_multics command.  It copies a
live process directory specified by process_dir_name into the directory
under the >dumps>save_pdirs directory.


Several hardcore segments needed by analyze_multics are also copied
into the directory.  Two segments are created by the copy_liveproc
tool, pdir_info and uid_hash_table.  These are used by analyze_multics
when examining a live process.  Any target segments pointed to by links
in the process directory will also be copied.  Access to the new pdir
is determined by the initial dir_acl of the save_pdirs directory.


Arguments:
process_dir_name
   is the name of the live process directory to be copied.  If just
   an entryname is given, it is assumed to be an entryname in >pdd
   (i.e., >process_dir_dir>process_dir_name).
user_name
   is the person_id of the user owning the process.  This name is used
   when creating the saved process directory.  The saved process
   directory is named user_name.pdir, where "pdir" is the standard
   suffix.  If user_name.pdir already exists, it is renamed, before
   copying the new directory, to user_name.N.pdir, where N=1.  If
   person.1.pdir already exists, it is renamed to person.N+1.pdir, and
   so on.


Control arguments:
-directory process_dir_name, -dr process_dir_name
   specifies the name of the process directory to be saved.
-name user_name, -nm user_name
   specifies the name of the user owning the process.
-owner, -ow
   specifies that access be set appropriately for the owner of the
   fatal process.  This access is status on the live process directory.


Access required: The use of this command requires access to phcs_.  A
user can copy his own process if he has "sma" on the save_pdirs
directory and access to phcs_.  If the live process doesn't belong to
the process doing the copying, access to the hphcs_ gate is required,
along with s access to >pdd and sma access to the target process
directory.  When copying a process at a different authorization level
than the process doing the copying, access to the system_privilege_
gate is required.


Examples:

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
