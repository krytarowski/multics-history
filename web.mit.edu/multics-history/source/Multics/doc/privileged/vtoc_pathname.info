02/28/85 vtoc_pathname

Syntax as a command:  vtoc_pathname volname vtocx {-control_arg}
vtoc_pathname pvtx vtocx {-control_arg}


Function:  determines the pathname of a segment from the location of
its VTOC entry (VTOCE).  Specify the location of the VTOCE by giving
its volume name (or physical volume table index, if known) and an index
into the VTOC of that volume.


Arguments:
volname
   is the physical volume name of the volume on which the VTOCE
   resides.  This volume must be mounted and must be part of a mounted
   logical volume.
pvtx
   is the physical volume table index of the volume on which the VTOCE
   resides, if known.  is the VTOC index of the VTOCE.  You must give
   it in octal.
vtocx
   is the VTOC index of the VTOCE.  You must give it in octal.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the printing of an error message when the VTOCE is free.


Access required:  You need access to the phcs_ gate, since it must copy
directories.


Notes:  Your process must have status access to each of the containing
directories of the segment.  The command supplies "-NO-ACCESS-" as the
entryname at the level at which further access is necessary, if needed;
it gives "-NOT-LISTED-" as the entryname at that level if one of the
containing directories specified in the VTOCE does not exist in its
containing directory; and it provides "-????-" as the entryname at any
level below that at which either of these problems occurs.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
