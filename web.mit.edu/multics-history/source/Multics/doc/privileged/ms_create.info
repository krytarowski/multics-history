02/26/85  ms_create, mscr

Syntax as a command:  mscr paths


Function:  creates a queue message segment with a specified name in a
specified directory.


Arguments:
paths
   are the pathnames of queues to be created.


Access required:  The user must have modify and append permission on
the directory in which he is creating a queue.


Notes:  If pathi does not have the ms suffix, it is assumed.

If the creation of a queue would introduce a duplication of names
within the directory, and if the old queue has only one name, the user
is interrogated as to whether he wishes the old queue to be deleted.
If the user answers "no", no action is taken.  If the old queue has
multiple names, the conflicting name is removed and a message to that
effect is issued to the user.

The extended access placed on a new queue message segment is

      adros     user who created the queue
      ao        *.SysDaemon.*

For more information on extended access, see the ms_set_acl command in
this document.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
