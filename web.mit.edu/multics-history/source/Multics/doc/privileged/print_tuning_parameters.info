02/26/85  print_tuning_parameters, ptp

Syntax as a command:  ptp {name1 ...  nameN} {-control_args}


Function:  prints the current values of various tuning parameters
within the system.  The values of most of these tuning parameters can
be changed by using the change_tuning_parameters command described
earlier in this section.


Arguments:
namei
   is the name of a tuning parameter whose value is to be printed.  It
   can be either the long name or the short name of the parameter.  If
   no names are supplied, all tuning parameters that can be changed
   while the system is running are printed.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   if no names are specified, prints all tuning parameters, including
   those that are "special" and not alterable while the system is
   running (e.g., max_max_eligible, which can only be changed by means
   of a bootload).
-long, -lg
   lists the short and long names of the parameter(s),as well as a
   pointer to the location of the tuning parameters in ring zero.
-short, -sh
   prints only the long name and the value of the parameter(s)
   (default).


Access required:  This command requires access to metering_gate_.


Notes:  See the Multics System Maintenance Procedures manual, Order No.
AM81, for explanations of the tuning parameters.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
