03/26/85 load_mpc

Syntax as a command:  load_mpc {mpc_name} {-control_args}


Function:  loads ITRs or application firmware or both into MPCs.


Arguments:
mpc_name
   is the name of the MPC to be tested or reloaded or both.  This name
   must appear on an mpc card in the config deck.  If this argument is
   omitted, the -channel control argument must be given.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   withholds printing of the names of the programs as they are run.
-channel channel_name, chn channel_name
   specifies a channel name, where channel_name is of the form
   {iomtag}channel_no (for example, a14).  The iomtag field must be the
   tag of a configured IOM and is required on multiple IOM systems.
   The channel_no field is an octal channel number.  If this control
   argument is used, the mpc_name argument is optional.  If both are
   used, the channel must be connected to the mpc specified.
-firm
   loads ony the standard firmware; ITRs are not run.
-itr
   loads only the ITRs; the standard firmware is not reloaded.


-revision RV, -rev RV
   specifies which revision of the firmware is to be loaded, where RV
   is a 2-character firmware revision code.  If multiple revisions
   exist and this argument is omitted, you are queried as to which
   revision to load.
-time, -tm
   prints timings for each program loaded into the MPC.


Access required:  To use load_mpc, you must have access to the phcs
gate.


Notes:  By default, this command suspends I/O on all devices connected
to the selected MPC, resets the controller, runs all the known ITRs,
reloads the standard firmware (including device routines for urmpc),
and restores I/O on all devices connected to the controller.

If any abnormal conditions occur, the program displays the status that
occurred, and stops.  I/O is left in a suspended state, because the MPC
has been left in an unusable state.  In order to return the controller
to operation, it is necessary to restore the firmware, using either
this command or TOLTS (documented in the Multics Online Test and
Diagnostics Manual, Order No.  AU77).

This command can be used on disk MPCs only if they are fully cross
barred.


Firmware and ITR modules are found in the Test and Diagnostics (T&D)
deckfile created by the load_tandd_library command (also documented in
the T&D manual).

The load_mpc command informs the operator via the system console of
major events during command execution.  This includes suspending I/O,
running ITRs, loading firmware, and resuming I/O (or leaving I/O
suspended).

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
