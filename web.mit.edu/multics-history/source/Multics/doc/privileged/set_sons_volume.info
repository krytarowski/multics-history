02/27/85 set_sons_volume

Syntax as a command:  set_sons_volume path LVNAME


Function:  used to set the logical volume on which the segments of a
directory reside.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the directory whose sons logical volume ID is to
   be set.
LVNAME
   is the name of the logical volume.


Access required:  Use of this command requires access to hphcs_.


Notes:  This is a highly privileged command, which defeats the normal
quota management for logical volumes.  Normally, this command is only
used in system_start_up.ec to set the logical volume for the directory
>pdd.  This operation is only valid on an empty directory.  The usual
method of creating a directory with a specific "sons logical volume" (a
master directory) is to use the create_dir command (described in the
Multics Commands and Active Functions manual, Order No.  AG92.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
