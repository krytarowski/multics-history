04/08/86  list_extra_personids

Syntax as a command:  list_extra_personids


Function: lists Person_ids that are registered in the PNT but do not
exist in any PDT.  Person_ids in a PDT but not in the PNT are also
listed.


Notes: This command is useful for checking the consistency of system
tables and listing those Person_ids that can be removed from the PNT to
compress it.  (See remove_user for more information.)

The command also references the SAT in  >scl and the PDTs for all valid
projects in >sc1>pdt.

First, the PDTs are scanned, and a list of users missing from the PNT
is printed.  This is probably due to errors by project or accounting
administrators.  Then a list of Person_ids in the PNT but not in the
PDTs is printed.

This command is expensive.  Therefore run it on absentee or at least
using file_output (see the Multics Commands and Active Functions
manual, AG92) so that the results can be saved.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
