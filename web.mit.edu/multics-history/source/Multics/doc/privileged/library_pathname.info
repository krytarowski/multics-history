02/10/86  library_pathname, lpn

Syntax as a command:  lpn {search_names} {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [lpn {search_names} {-control_args}]


Function:  returns the pathname of one or more entries in a library.
Archive pathnames are returned in the case of archive component entries
in the library.

This command uses library descriptor and library search procedures, as
described in "The Library Descriptor Commands" of the Multics Library
Maintenance (AN80) manual.


Arguments:
search_names
   are entrynames that identify the library entries whose pathnames are
   to be returned.  The star convention can be used to identify a group
   of entries with a single search name.  Up to 1000 search names can
   be given in the command.  If none are given, then any default search
   names specified for the library_info command in the library
   descriptor are used.


Control arguments:
-descriptor desc_name, -desc desc_name
   provides a pathname or reference name that identifies the library
   descriptor describing the libraries to be searched.  If no
   -descriptor control argument is supplied, then the default library
   descriptor is used.  The initial default library descriptor
   describes the Multics System Libraries.
-library library_name, -lb library_name
   identifies a library that is to be searched for entries matching the
   search names.  The star convention can be used to identify a group
   of libraries to be searched.  Up to 100 -library control arguments
   can be given in each command.  If none are given, then any default
   library names specified for the library_info command in the library
   descriptor are used.


-search_name search_name
   identifies a search name that begins with a minus (-) to distinguish
   the search name from a control argument.  There are no other
   differences between the search names described above and those given
   with the -search_name control argument.  One or more -search_name
   control arguments can be given in the command.
-all_matches, -amch
   returns the names of all entries matching the specified search
   names. (Default as a command)
-first_match, -fmch
   returns only the name of the first entry matching a specified search
   name. (Default as an active function)

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
