02/28/85 wire_pages

Syntax as a command:  wire_pages path {first_page n_pages}
   {-control_arg}


Function:  wires all, or selected, pages of a segment into main memory.
Such pages are not subject to removal by the page replacement
algorithm.  Wired pages remain in memory until shutdown, or until
unwired.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the segment to be wired.  Supervisor segments
   cannot be wired by this command.
first_page
   specifies the page number of the first page to be wired.  The first
   page of a segment is page zero.  If this argument is specified, the
   next argument must be specified.  The default is to wire all pages.
   If first_page ends with a decimal point, it is treated as a decimal
   number, otherwise it is treated as an octal number.
n_pages
   specifies the number of pages to be wired.  If n_pages ends with a
   decimal point, it is treated as a decimal number, otherwise it is
   treated as an octal number.


Control arguments:
-text
   to specify that path is an object segment and that only the text
   section should be wired.  The default is to wire the whole segment.


Access required:  Use of this command requires re access to the hphcs_
gate.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
