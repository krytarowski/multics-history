02/28/85 sys_full_report

Syntax as a command:  sys_full_report {log1 log2 ...  logN}
   {-control_arg}


Function:  is used by the crank in master.ec to update, and by
biller.ec to print, the contents of a segment containing a history of
all instances where a user was refused login because the system was
full.


Arguments:
logi
   is the pathname of a system log segment.


Control arguments:
-print
   print the contents of the segment.


Notes:  The history is kept in the segment sys_full_report_seg in the
working directory (normally >udd>SysAdmin>admin).  This segment is
created if it does not exist.

If given, the -print control argument must be the last, or the only,
argument.  The crank (in master.ec) invokes this command with the name
of just one log segment at a time; the biller.ec segment invokes it
with just the -print control argument.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
