02/27/85 reset_usage

Syntax as a command:  reset_usage sat_path pdt_dir admin_sat admin_pdt


Function:  subtracts the resource usage in each PDT located in an
administrative directory from the resource usage information in the
system copy of each PDT.  This procedure modifies only the system copy
of the PDTs.


Arguments:
admin_pdt
   is the pathname of the directory in which administrative copies of
   the PDTs reside.
admin_sat
   is the pathname of an administrative copy of the SAT.
pdt_dir
   is the pathname of the directory containing the system copies of the
   PDTs.
sat_path
   is the pathname of the system copy of the SAT.


Notes:  This command is used by biller.ec.  Projects are billed for the
usage recorded in the administrative copies of the PDTs.  (These copies
are created by the crank, called by master.ec, from the system copies
of the PDTs.)  Meanwhile, logged in users are accruing additional usage
charges, recorded in the system copies of the PDTs.  Execution of this
command subtracts the charges that have just been billed, leaving in
the system PDTs only the most recently accrued charges that have not
yet been billed.

If the system crashes while this command is running, the command can be
restarted from the beginning.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
