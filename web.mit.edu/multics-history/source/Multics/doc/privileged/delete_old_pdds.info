09/10/86  delete_old_pdds

Syntax as a command:  delete_old_pdds {-control_args}


Function: deletes old copies of >process_dir_dir and system_library_1
created during bootload.


Control arguments:
-exclude_first N
   does not delete the first N old copies of >process_dir_dir and
   >system_library_1 (that is, the N oldest ones).
-exclude_last N
   does not delete the last N old copies of >process_dir_dir and
   >system_library_1 (that is, the N most recent ones).


Access required: You need access to the hphcs_ gate.


Notes: This command is intended for use mainly in the start_up.ec of
Utility.SysDaemon.  If the system is unable to boot for lack of quota,
boot to standard and run from the initializer process in admin mode.

The old copies of >process_dir_dir are named pdd.[unique], and branch
directly off the root.  The old copies of >system_library_1 are named
sl1.[unique], and also branch directly off the root.

The control arguments are useful when you need to have the process
directory contents of processes at the time of a crash, to debug system
problems.

If the process running delete_old_pdds has access to the soos
privilege, it is enabled to allow salvaging of soos directories.  Run
this command in a process with access to the soos privilege.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
