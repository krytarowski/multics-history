02/27/85 reset_disk_meters

Syntax as a command:  reset_disk_meters {path} {-control_arg}


Function:  subtracts the time-page-product (tpp) for each directory in
the Multics hierarchy listed in disk_stat from the tpp integrator of
the directory itself.  This operation is done once each month after
users have been billed for disk usage.  Privileged entry points in the
hphcs_ gate are used to do the work.  A comment is printed if the
branch does not exist or a negative tpp would result, but the program
continues.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the disk_stat segment containing the usage values
   to be subtracted from the tpp integrators.  The default is the
   segment disk_stat in the working directory.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   specifies that the user is not to be informed when it is necessary
   to force access to a directory to reset its tpp.


Notes:  This command forces access to directories, if necessary, and
removes the access when finished.  It reports when it must do this,
unless the -brief control argument is given, and it always reports if
unable to force access.

After resetting all of the tpps, it zeros the per-project disk usage
figures in the segment projfile, in the working directory.  (This
segment is an implicit input to the command.)

If the system crashes while this command is running, the command can be
restarted from the beginning.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
