02/25/85 make_commands

Syntax as a command:  make_commands path_name


Function:  creates a Limited Service Subsystem (LSS) control segment
from an ASCII input segment.  The control segment is referenced by the
Limited Service System (LSS) when it is limiting the commands and
percentage of CPU time of a user (see also the enter_lss command).

The input segment consists of a series of statements.  Each statement
is composed of two parts.  The first part is the name of the command to
be transformed; i.e., the command that is to be typed by the user in a
limited system.  If there is more than one name for the command, they
should all be enclosed in parentheses and separated from each other by
one or more blanks.  The name field is terminated by a colon preceded
by any number of blanks.


The second part of each statement is the pathname (which may be a
relative pathname) of the command to be executed when the user types
one of the names in the first part.  If a relative pathname is used, it
is relative to the current working directory.  If only an entryname is
given, the standard system search rules are applied.  It is followed by
any number of blanks and terminated by a semicolon.  If the pathname is
omitted (semicolon still required), it is assumed to be the same as the
last name in the name field.

The first and second parts of each statement may be separated from each
other by any number of blanks or tabs.  Newlines are ignored and are
allowed anywhere.  Comments enclosed between "/*" and "*/" are allowed
and are treated as blanks.


If the first two statements have as their first part the names "ratio"
and "interval", respectively, the second parts of the two statements
are assumed to be decimal integers to be assigned to the ratio and
interval_length variables of the LSS control segment.  Otherwise, the
two variables are set to zero.

The ratio and interval variables control the amount of CPU time used by
the process.  The LSS forces the process to use no more than
(interval/ratio) virtual CPU seconds in each (interval) real second(s).
If it attempts to do so, the process is rendered inactive for the
remainder of the interval.


Arguments:
path_name
   is the pathname of an ASCII input segment that has the name
   path_name.ct.  (The .ct suffix is assumed if it is not included.)
   The output segment has the same entryname as the input segment with
   the .ct suffix removed, and is placed in the working directory.


Notes:  See the enter_lss command for additional information.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
