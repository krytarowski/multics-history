02/27/85  send_admin_command, sac

Syntax as a command:  sac {-control_args} commandline


Function:  sends a command line to the initializer process for
execution.


Arguments:
commandline
   is the command line to be sent to the initializer.  To send special
   characters you must enclose them (or the whole command line) in
   quotes.  If the first character of the command is a "-" character,
   the "-string" control argument must be used.


Control arguments:
-address MAIL_ADDRESS
   specifies that mail sent for notifications is to be sent to the mail
   address specified by MAIL_ADDRESS.  In most cases, the MAIL_ADDRESS
   can be in the form Person_id.Project or Person_id.  (Type "help
   mail_addresses.gi" for additional information on mail address
   specification).
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the printing of informational messages.
-brief_query, -bfqy
   specifies that a brief query is to be posed before the command is
   executed.
-long, -lg
   prints the messages suppressed by -brief.  This is the default.


-no_notify_by_message, -nntmsg
   specifies that the user is to receive no interactive messages
   concerning the execution of the command, except in the special case
   that -no_wait is specified and the execution of the command is
   denied due to lack of access.
-no_query, -nqy
   specifies that no query is to be posed before sending the command
   line.  This is the default.
-no_wait, -nwt
   specifies that the command return to the listener as soon as the
   commandline has been sent to the initializer.
-notify_by_mail, -ntmail
   specifies that the user is to be sent mail in the following cases:
   (1) -no_wait is specified, and execution of the command line is
   denied due to lack of access.  (2) the command completes execution.


   By default, the mail will be sent to the destination specified in
   the user's mail table entry.  If no destination is found there, the
   full User.Project specification will be used.  The default may be
   overridden with the -address control argument.  If the command is
   executed, the mail will contain all output produced on the
   error_output, user_output, and user_i/o switches during the command
   execution.
-notify_by_message, -ntmsg
   specifies that the user is to receive a brief notification by
   interactive message in the following cases:  (1) -no_wait is
   specified, and execution of the command line is denied due to lack
   of access.  (2) The command completes execution.


   If possible, the user's mail table entry will be used to determine
   the delivery address.  If not, the full User.Project specification
   will be used.  The -address control argument does not apply to
   interactive messages.
-query, -qy, -long_query, -lgqy
   specifies that the command line is to be displayed on the terminal
   and that the user is to be queried before the command line is
   executed.  This control argument is useful for validating the
   effects of abbrevs and active functions.
-string
   specifies that the rest of the command line is to be interpreted as
   the command to be executed, whether or not it begins with a "-".


-wait WAIT_TYPE, -wt WAIT_TYPE
   specifies that the command must wait for a specified event before
   returning to the listener.  WAIT_TYPE can be one of the following
   values:
   start
      specifies that the command is to wait for the initializer to
      acknowledge receipt of the command line before returning to the
      listener.
   finish
      specifies that the command is to wait for the inititalizer to
      finish execution of the command line before returning to the
      listener.  This is the default.


Access required:  RW access to >sc1>admin_acs>send_admin_command.acs is
required to use this command.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
