08/11/87 list_proc_required

Syntax as a command:  list_proc_required {-control_arg}


Syntax as an active function:  [list_proc_required {control_arg}]


Function:  determines the group of CPUs on which the invoking process
can be run or the default group of CPUs for all processes that have not
requested specific CPUs.


Control arguments:
-priv
   indicates that this command applies to the default group of CPUs for
   processes that have not requested specific CPUs.  If omitted, this
   command applies to the group of CPUs for the invoking process only.


Access required:  This command requires access to
>sc1>admin_acs>set_proc_required.acs.  If -priv is used, access to
phcs_ or metering_gate_ is also required.


Notes:  When invoked as a command without the -priv control argument,
list_proc_required indicates that the set of CPUs needed for this
process is the system default by printing "(default)" following the
list of CPUs.  This information is not provided when list_proc_required
is invoked as an active function.  If invoked as an active function, it
returns a string of CPU tags that represent the group of CPUs requested
(e.g., "ABCF").

This command prints the list of CPUs required as an uppercase string.
If invoked as an active function, it prints the returned list of CPU
tags in uppercase.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
