07/08/88 list_vols

Syntax as a command:  list_vols {lv_name} {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [list_vols {lv_name} {-control_args}]


Function:  prints information about currently-mounted physical or
logical volumes.  Several of the items printed by list_vols can also be
obtained as return values by invoking list_vols as an active function.


Arguments:
lv_names
   prints information about the logical volume lv_name.  This is the
   default if a name is given without -lv or -pv preceding it.


Control arguments:
-grand_total, -gtt
   prints a single number about the total records left or records used
   on the system.  This is used in conjunction with the -rec_used
   control argument, or if no other control argument is given,
   -rec_left is assumed.  This allows a command line equivalent of
   active function usage as:  [list_vols -rec_left] or [list_vols
   -rec_used] where -rec_left is also the default.
-lv name(s)
   prints information about the logical volume(s) named.  A single name
   or several names, separated by space, can be given.
-pv name
   prints information about only the physical volume named.


-records, -rec
   prints only the number of records on the specified volume(s),
   exclusive of records occupied by partitions and the volume table of
   contents (VTOC).  This is one of the items that can be obtained as
   an active function return value.
-records_left, -rec_left
   prints only the number of records on the specified volume(s) that
   are currently unused and are available to hold the pages of segments
   and directories.  This is one of the items that can be obtained as
   an active function return value.  (This is the default.)


-records_used, -rec_used
   prints the number of records on the specified volume(s) that are
   used.  This can be obtained as an active function value.
-totals, -tt
   does not print information for individual physical volumes but
   rather totals and prints for each logical volume.


Access required:  This command requires access to phcs_ or
metering_gate_ as well as mdc_.


Notes:  If no volume name is given, the list_vols command prints
information about all mounted logical volumes.

If physical volume information is being printed, there may be up to two
flags printed immediately to the right of the drive name.  The flags
are "X" (if a drive is inoperative) and "I" (if a drive is inhibited
for segment creation).

If a physical volume information is being printed, the average segment
size, to the nearest record, is printed per physical volume.

If either logical volume or physical volume information is being
printed, the percentages used or left for Records and VTOCEs is
printed.

If list_vols is used as an active function, either the -records or the
-records_left control argument must be given.

If the -totals argument is given together with the name of a logical
volume, a single line containing totals information for that logical
volume is printed.

If physical volume information is being printed (-totals not given),
the output lines contain the following items:

      Drive  flag  Records  Left  VTOCEs  Left  PV Name  PB/PD LV Name

If logical volume information is being printed (-totals given), the
output lines contain the following items:

      Records   Left   VTOCEs   Left PB/PD LV Name

The following are brief descriptions of the above variables.
Drive
   is the name of the drive on which the physical volume is mounted.
flag
   is the letter "X" if the drive is inoperative.
Records
   is the number of records not occupied by partitions or the VTOC, and
   therefore usable for the pages of segments and entries.


Left
   is the number of records currently unused and therefore available
   for the pages of segments and directories.
VTOCEs
   is the number of VTOC entries.
Left
   is the number of unused VTOC directories.
PV Name
   is the name of the physical volume.


PB/PD
   contains "pb" if the logical volume is public, and "pd" if it has
   been designated as being available to hold the segments in process
   directories.
LV Name
   is the name of the logical volume.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
