08/13/87 check_cpu_speed

Syntax as a command:  check_cpu_speed {cpu_tags} {-control_args}


Function:  performs a relative check of the speed of a currently
running CPU on the system.


Arguments:
cpu_tags
   are the tags of CPUs configured on the system.  If more than one is
   supplied, the values must be separated by spaces.  The default is to
   run on all CPUs listed by the list_proc_required command that are
   currently marked as ON in the configuration deck.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   does not display information for a CPU that is found to be within
   the acceptable speed window.

-warn
   displays a message on the operator's console when a CPU is found to
   to be slower than the acceptable speed.


Access required:  This command requires access to
>sc1>admin_acs>set_proc_required.acs to run.  Use of the -warn control
argument requires access to phcs_.


Notes:  If the speed is found to be less than acceptable the program
will attempt to determine if it is because the associative memory or
the cache memory is off.  Your process is left running with the
original set of system CPUs.

The command runs on a CPU outside of your original set of CPUs if the
CPU tag is given on the command line.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
