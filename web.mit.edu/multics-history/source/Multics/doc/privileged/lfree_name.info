Entry points in lfree_name lfn:
   (List is generated by the help command)


:Entry: lfree_name:lfn: 03/11/83  lfree_name, lfn


Syntax:  lfree_name pathname


Function:  interfaces with the installation subroutine that frees names
on one directory entry so that those names can be used on a replacement
entry.  It is part of the Multics Installation System (MIS), which is
used to install modifications in the Multics Online Libraries.


Arguments:
pathname
   is the relative or absolute pathname that identifies the entry whose
   name is to be freed.  Only the final entryname of the pathname is
   freed.  All other names on the entry remain intact.  The star
   convention can not be used.


:Entry:  restore:  03/11/83 lfree_name lfn$restore


Function:  This entry point unfrees (or restores) a freed entryname by
reversing the algorithm described above.


Syntax:  lfree_name$restore pathname


Arguments:
pathname
   is the relative or absolute pathname that identifies the restored
   entryname.  A freed name is constructed from this entryname, the
   directory entry having the freed name is found, and its name is
   restored to entryname.


Notes:  This entry point calls an installation subroutine that is part
of the MIS to free entry names.  This installation subroutine, in turn,
calls the installation_tools_ gate into ring 1 to allow the names on
ring 1 library segments to be freed.  However, access to
installation_tools_ is no longer required in order to use this tool.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
