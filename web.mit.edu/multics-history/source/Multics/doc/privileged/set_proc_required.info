08/11/87  set_proc_required, sprq

Syntax as a command:  sprq {tag1}...{tag2}...{tagi} {-control_arg}


Function:  restricts processes to run only on specified CPUs.  It can
be used to specify the set of CPUs on which the invoking process can be
run and the default set of CPUs for all processes that have not
requested specific CPUs.


Arguments:
tagi
   is the tag for one of the CPUs in the group being specified.  It can
   be one of the letters a through h or A through H.  If no tag is
   specified, the group is assumed to contain all CPUs (tags A through
   H).  If -priv is given, then at least one tag is required.


Control arguments:
-priv
   indicates that the group of CPUs specified is to become the default
   group for processes that have not requested specific CPUs.  If
   omitted, the group of CPUs specified applies only to the invoking
   process.


Access required: This command requires access to
>sc1>admin_acs>set_proc_required.acs.  If the -priv control argument is
specified, access to phcs_ and hphcs_ is needed.


Notes:  If none of the CPUs specified are online, an error message is
printed, and the command has no effect.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
