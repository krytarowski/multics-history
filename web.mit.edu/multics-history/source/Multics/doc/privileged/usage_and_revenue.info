02/28/85 usage_and_revenue

Syntax as a command:  usage_and_revenue control data {old_data}


Function:  prints out a report of system usage and revenue broken down
by groups of users.

The following lines must be added to master.ec and biller.ec before
this command can be invoked.  To master.ec add

      file_output usage_and_revenue.report
      usage_and_revenue usage_and_revenue.control today.use_totals
         yesterday.use_totals
      console_output


To biller.ec add

      file_output monthly_usage_and_revenue.report
      usage_and_revenue usage_and_revenue.control today.use_totals
      console_output



Arguments:
control
   is the pathname of an ASCII file that defines the groups of users
   for the report.
data
   is the pathname of a copy of the system use_totals month-to-date
   statistical data base.
old_data
   is the pathname of an earlier copy of the system use_totals
   month-to-date statistical data base.


Notes:  If both the data and old_data arguments are given, a daily
report is produced showing the incremental system usage between the
time old_data was created and the time data was created.  If only the
data argument is given, a monthly report is produced showing the
month-to-date usage at the time data was created.

The control file may specify up to nine groups of users to be shown in
the report.  Each line of the control file specifies one group; each
group consists of one or more of the usage bins from the use_totals
data base.  The format of a control file line is

      Group title:user1,user2,...,userN

Lines beginning with an asterisk (*) are ignored.  The groups appear in
the report in the same order in which they appear in the control file.


List of arguments:
group title
   is the title used to identify the group in the report.  The maximum
   length is 24 (spaces are allowed).
useri
   are the names of the usage bins in the use_totals data base that are
   to be included in this group.  These are the names specified in the
   control file for reset_use_totals.  If useri is enclosed in quotes,
   it specifies a group that is already defined in the control file and
   all the bins that go into that group also go into this group.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
