02/21/85 install

Syntax as a command:  install path {-control_args}


Function:  requests installation of a system control table.  The
request is transmitted to the system control process which validates
the request and performs the installation.  A message from the system
control process indicates successful installation or rejection of the
table.

A project administrator can install a PDT only; a system administrator
can also install a number of additional tables.


Arguments:
path
   is the relative or absolute pathname of the table to be installed.
   The appropriate suffix (e.g., pdt) must be given.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   installs all attributes.
-attributes, -attr
   installs only nonsecurity related attributes.  This is the default
   if no control arguments are specified.
-authorization, -auth
   installs only security related attributes.


Notes:  The install command reports PDT parameters that exceed limits
specified for the project in the SAT, but it allows the PDT to be
installed.  If the SAT limits are not subsequently raised, they are
enforced at login time and a message to that effect is logged.  This is
done for the initial ring, max ring, grace time, and pdir quota
parameters.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
