02/25/85  list_volume_registration, lvr

Syntax as a command:  lvr control args


Function:  displays the registration information for a physical volume
or a logical volume with all its physical volumes.


Control arguments:
The "-physical_volume" or the "-logical_volume" control argument is
required and must immediately follow the command name.  (Only one may
be supplied.)
-physical_volume PV_NAME, -pv PV_NAME
   specifies that the registration information for the given physical
   volume is to be displayed.


-logical_volume LV_NAME, -lv LV_NAME
   specifies that the registration information for the given logical
   volume is to be displayed.
-brief, -bf
   if given with the "-logical_volume" control argument, will specify
   that only the names of the physical volumes are to be displayed.  No
   other information is given.  This control argument is ignored when

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
