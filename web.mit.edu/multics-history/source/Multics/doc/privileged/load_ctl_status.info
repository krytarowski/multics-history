02/25/85 load_ctl_status

Syntax as a command:  load_ctl_status {group} {-control_args}


Function:  prints the current status of the system load control groups.
It does this by printing selected items from the system copy of the
master group table (MGT).


Arguments:
group
   if specified, prints only the header and the line for the group
   named; otherwise, prints one line for each group in the MGT.  Each
   line gives the maximum number of primary load units, the current
   number of primary load units, the current number of secondary load
   units, and, if the group has an absolute maximum, the total and
   maximum number of units.  Also, the group's current load, as a
   percent of the total allowable system load, is given.


Control arguments:
-long, -lg
   requests a long format header.
-total, -tt
   requests that only a header be printed.


Notes:  If the priority scheduler is enabled, then each line gives, in
addition, the interactive and absentee work class of the group, and the
header contains two additional lines giving the defined work classes
and their percents, for the current shift.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
