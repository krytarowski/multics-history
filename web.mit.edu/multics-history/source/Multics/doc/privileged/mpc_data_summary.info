03/27/85 mpc_data_summary

Syntax as a command:  mpc_data_summary {list} {-control_args}


Function:  scans the syserr log and summarizes the MPC statistics
placed there by poll_mpc.


Arguments:
list
   is a list of MPC controller names for which the data is to be
   summarized (i.e., mspa mtpb urpa).  The MPC controller names must be
   four characters long, and the first three characters must be msp,
   mtp, or urp.  The default list is of all MPCs found in the log.


Control arguments:
-all
   reports all MPCs found in the syserr log.
-brief, -bf
   reports only nonzero device statistics.
-expand
   expands each syserr log entry that is used for the summary.  This
   may cause much output.
-extend, -ext
   extends the output file if it exists.  The default is to overwrite
   the file.
-for T
   computes the ending time from the starting time, where T is a
   relative time (such as 1hour or 1day).


-from DT, fm DT
   starts scanning the log at the date/time given.
-long, lg
   reports all device statistics.  This is the default.
-mpc list
   displays MPC error data only.
-output_file {path}, -of {path}
   directs output to the segment specified by path.  If path is not
   given, a default segment is used in the working directory and named
   mpc_data_summary.output.


-short
   formats output for devices with fewer than 132 columns.  The default
   is based on output file type and can be used to override the file
   output default.
-to DT
   stops scanning the log at the date/time given.


Access required:  Read permission is required on the log segments
themselves, and status permission is required on their containing
directories.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
