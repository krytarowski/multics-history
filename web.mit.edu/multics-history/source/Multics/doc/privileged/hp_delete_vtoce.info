02/08/85 hp_delete_vtoce

Syntax as a command:  hp_delete_vtoce pvname vtoc_index {-control_args}


Function:  deletes a specified Volume Table of Contents Entry (VTOCE).
You can use it when cleaning up after a sweep_pv to get rid of orphans,
or whenever you want a forward connection failure.


Arguments:
pvname
   is the name of the physical volume on which the VTOCE to be expunged
   exists.
vtoc_index
   is the index (in octal) of the VTOCE to be expunged.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the message announcing the deletion of the VTOCE, which
   is only printed if no questions are asked.
-clear
   uses the privileged entry that sets an entire VTOCE to zero, rather
   than deleting it.  Give -clear only when a VTOCE contains invalid
   information that may cause problems (reused addresses, crashes,
   etc.)  if you delete it as usual, since it leaves the volume on
   which the VTOCE existed in an inconsistent state.  Salvage such
   volume with the volume salvager after you have deleted all the
   seriously inconsistent VTOCEs.  Don't use this control argument to
   delete a reverse connection failure VTOCE (an ordinary orphan).


-force, -fc
   forces the deletion of the VTOCE if it is an orphan, with no
   intervening questions; if it is not, you must supply also -no_check
   to suppress all questions.
-no_check, -nch
   suppresses the check made to see whether or not the VTOCE is an
   orphan; if it is not, deleting it causes a forward connection
   failure in its parent directory.
-query, -qy
   always queries whether or not to delete the VTOCE, even if it is an
   orphan.


Access required:  You require access to the phcs_ and hphcs_ gates.


Notes:  You cannot use this command to delete the VTOCE of an active
segment.  The default is to check whether the VTOCE is an orphan, and
delete it if it is, or ask whether to delete it if is not.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
