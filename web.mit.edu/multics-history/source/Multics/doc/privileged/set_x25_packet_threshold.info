02/27/85 set_x25_packet_threshold

Syntax as a command:  set_x25_packet_threshold channel_name packet_size


Function:  sets the minimum size of X.25 "long" packets.  Packets of
this size or larger are given lower priority than short packets.


Arguments:
channel_name
   is the name of an X.25 multiplexer channel.
packet_size
   is the minimum length of a long packet, in characters.


Access required:  Use of this command requires access to the hphcs_
gate.


Notes:  If packet_size is set larger than the maximum packet size in
use by the multiplexer, no packets are given preferential treatment on
the basis of size.  The initial value of the minimum long packet size
is determined by the "packet_threshold" parameter in the terminal type
definition for the multiplexer.  The present value of the parameter,
and the maximum size for all packets, is included in the output from
the tty_dump command.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
