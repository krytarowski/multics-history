03/31/83  l_patch

Syntax:  l_patch segment offset value_ ...  value_


Function:  intended to be a tool for those users who maintain the
online system libraries.  It is used to change selected locations of a
ring 1 segment.  It requires write access to the directory containing
the segment and access to the gate segment installation_tools_.


Arguments:
segment
   is the pathname or segment number of the segment to be patched.
offset
   is the offset of the first word to be changed; it must be expressed
   as an octal number.
value_
   are the new values for the locations to be changed.


Notes:
When in ring 1, the user is given rew access to the segment
before the patch is made.  This is done by adding an access control
list (ACL) entry to the segment with the access control name,
"person.project.tag".  This ACL entry is removed after the patch is
complete.

The command prints out the changes that will be made and asks the
user if these changes are correct.  In order for the patch to be done,
the user must answer "yes" followed by the newline character.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
