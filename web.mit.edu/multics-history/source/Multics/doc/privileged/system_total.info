02/28/85 system_total

Syntax as a command:  system_total meter_data use_totals


Function:  inspects a daily copy of the answering service metering
segment, extracts system availability and performance information, and
places it in a month-to-date statistical data base.


Arguments:
meter_data
   is the pathname of the meter data base in the form produced by
   as_meter_.
use_totals
   is the pathname of the statistical data base.


Notes:  This command is executed by the crank (in master.ec).  The
meter_data segment is a copy, made by the copy_as_meters command, of
the segment actually being used by as_meter_.  The use_totals segment
is today.use_totals, which is subsequently used as input to the
system_daily_report program.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
