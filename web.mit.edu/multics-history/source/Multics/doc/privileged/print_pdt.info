02/26/85 print_pdt

Syntax as a command:  print_pdt path {Person_ids} {-control_args}


Function:  The print_pdt command prints a listing of a project
definition table (PDT).


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the PDT segment to be printed.  If the pdt suffix
   is not given, it is assumed.  If the pathname given does not start
   with a greater-than or less-than character, it is interpreted as a
   project name and the PDT in the directory containing PDTs (>sc1>pdt)
   is used.
Person_ids
   are the Person_ids about whom information is desired.  If this
   argument is omitted, information is printed for all users listed in
   the PDT.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   prints small amount of information about each user.
-long, -lg
   prints all data items in the PDT.
-no_header, -nhe
   suppresses printing of the header.
-pmf
   prints the PDT in project master file (PMF) format.  The file_output
   command (described in the Multics Commands and Active Functions
   manual, Order No.  AG92) can be used to place the printed PDT in a
   segment for daemon printing or for subsequent use as a PMF (see
   "Notes" below).


Notes:  If no control arguments are given with this command, all
PMF-specifiable attributes and the total amount spent are printed.  The
user must have read access to the PDT; usually only project
administrators have such access.  The following command line is
recommended to make a PMF from a PDT.

      fo Project_id;print_pdt Project_id -pmf;ro

See also the proj_usage_report command to get a brief summary of each
user's resource consumption and the display_account_status command to
obtain the charges accrued to the account.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
