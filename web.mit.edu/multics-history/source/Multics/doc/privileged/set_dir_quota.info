02/27/85 set_dir_quota

Syntax as a command:  set_dir_quota path1 quota1 ...  pathN quotaN


Function:  places an arbitrary secondary storage quota for directories
on a specified directory.  Incorrect use of this command can make
portions of the hierarchy unusable because of quota violations.


Arguments:
pathi
   is the name of the directory on which the directory quota is to be
   placed.  The active function -wd can be used to specify the working
   directory.
quotai
   is the directory quota in 1024 word pages.


Access required:  The user must have access to the highly privileged
gate hphcs_ to use this command.


Notes:  No permission in the directory is required to use this command.
It is not necessary that the new directory quota be greater than the
current number of pages being used by directories in this directory.
This command attempts to set a terminal directory quota even if it set
set to zero.  This command does not cause the inferior counts of the
superior directory to be updated.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
