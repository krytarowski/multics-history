04/04/86  command_usage_count, cuc

Syntax:  cuc operation {command_names} {-control_args}


Function: provides a record of the number of times commands are used
and the User_ids for each invocation of them.


List of operations:
add
   adds commands to the list of commands to be metered.  Commands added
   to the list in a single invocation form a command "group," which you
   can manipulate as a whole.
delete, dl
   deletes command groups from the list of commands to be metered.
print, pr
   prints, and clears, the metered data (subject to any restrictions
   the specified control_args impose).


Arguments:
command_names
   are long or short names of commands.  With either the print or
   delete operation, you need give only one command name from each
   group to be printed or deleted; all the commands in each group so
   represented are acted upon.  If you supply no names with the print
   or delete operation, all command groups are printed/deleted.  You
   must use long and/or short command names with the add operation; all
   the names added in a single invocation are added as a single group
   to the list.  You can only use short names of commands with the
   print and delete operations if you specified them with the add
   operation.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   prints meters for all the command groups or deletes all command
   groups from the list.  You can't use it with the add operation.
   (Default for the print and delete operations if you give no
   command_names)
 -brief, -bf
   omits column headings from the printout.  You can only use it with
   the print operation.  (Default: to print column headings)
-clear, -cl
   clears the usage counters and user list when meters are printed.
   You can only use it with the print operation.  It clears the user
   list even if you also supply -total.


-first N, -ft N
   prints only the N greatest users of the specified commands.  You can
   only use it with the print operation. You can't use it in
   conjunction with -total.
-total, -tt
   prints only the total use of the commands in the specified command
   groups when used with the print operation; meters only the total
   usage of commands specified when used with the add operation.  You
   can't use it with the delete operation.  (Default with both of these
   operations: to print/meter the users of the commands as well as
   total usage; see "Notes" below)


Access required: To add and delete commands and to clear meters, you
must have rw access to the command_usage_list_ segment.  All users
should have r access to command_usage_list_ and rw access to
command_usage_totals_.  Both segments are found using object search
rules and most commonly are in >sss (system_library_standard
directory).  If they are not in >sss, a link in >sss points to them.


Notes: The commands to be metered must be listed in a segment named
command_usage_list_.  Usage totals are stored in a segment named
command_usage_totals_.  This command actually performs three
operations: it prints and clears the meters, adds commands to
command_usage_list_, and deletes commands from command_usage_list_.


For each group of commands added without -total, cuc creates a segment
named command_name.usage in >sss (or, if a link is there, wherever the
link points).  You must put the link in >sss before the first usage of
"cuc add," since the metering program creates the command_name.usage
segment in the same directory in which it finds command_usage_list_.
The command_name.usage segment contains the list of User_ids for those
using the commands in the group.  User_ids are printed in the order of
greatest usage.  When you supply -first, in addition to printing the
user count and name for the N greatest users, cuc prints an additional
line giving the user count for "all others."

At sites using the access isolation mechanism (AIM), only the usage of
system_low users is recorded.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
