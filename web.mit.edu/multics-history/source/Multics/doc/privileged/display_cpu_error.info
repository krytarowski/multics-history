03/26/85 display_cpu_error

Syntax as a command:  display_cpu_error {-control_args}


Function:  scans the syserr log and displays machine conditions and
history registers.


Control arguments:
-from DT, -fm DT
   starts scanning the log at the date/time given.
-to DT
   stops scanning the log at the date/time given.
-for T
   computes the ending time from the starting time, where T is a
   relative time (such as "1hour").
-cpu CPU_LIST
   displays information for the CPUs specified, where CPU_LIST is a
   list of CPU tags (e.g., "a c").
-nothread
   specifies that the history registers are not to be threaded.  The
   history registers will be output in octal with no interpretation.
   The default is off.


-expand, -exp
   specifies that the history registers are not to be threaded but that
   they are to be interpreted.
-match STR...STRn
   matches strings against messages in the log, where STR is a text
   string.  Messages are defined to contain process or machine
   condition information.  Any message that contains a STRi is
   displayed.
-exclude STR1...STRn, -ex STR1...STRn
   matches strings against messages in the log as -match, where STR is
   a text string.  Any message that contains a STRi is NOT displayed.
-all
   specifies that all log entries that are defined to contain processor
   machine information can be displayed.


Access required:  Read permission is required on the log segments
themselves and status permission is required on their containing
directories.


Notes:  If -from DT is not given, the scan starts with the earliest
entry in the syserr log.  The ending time can be specified by using
-for or -to, but not both.  If both are omitted, the scan terminates
with the last entry in the log.  All dates and times must be in a
format acceptable to the convert_date_to_binary_ subroutine described
in the Multics Subroutines and I/O Modules manual, Order No.  AG93.

Unless the control arguments -all, -match, or -exclude are specified,
only hardware_fault entries will be processed.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
