04/05/85 recover_volume_log

Syntax as a command:  recover_volume_log pvnames {-control_args}


Function:  recovers volume logs from dump volumes.  It should be
invoked only if volume logs for physical volumes to be reloaded cannot
be found.  Its input is a list of the latest dump volumes for the
physical volumes in question as specified by the caller.  This command
can be used in ring 1 or ring 4.


Arguments:
pvnames
   are the names of the physical volumes whose volume logs are to be
   recovered.  All pvnames supplied must be valid physical volume names
   (i.e., the physical volumes must be valid members of a registered
   logical volume).


Control arguments:
-input_volume_desc STR
   where STR is the attach description used to replace the default
   attach description "tape_mult_ ^a -system".  The dump volume name is
   inserted in the attach description at the first occurrence of the
   string "^a" in the attach description.
-working_dir, -wd
   specifies that the volume backup databases are to be recovered
   relative to the working directory.  The default is to recover them
   relative to the >ddd>volume_backup directory.  This control argument
   can be used to recover the volume logs for physical volumes that are
   not part of the currently mounted storage system.  This control
   argument is optional.


Notes:  No announcement of the recovery of any volume logs is provided
until all volume logs have been recovered or the query for the dump
volume name is answered with a period (".").

After a recover_volume_log operation is executed, it may be necessary
to run a merge_volume_log operation.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
