04/05/85 verify_dump_volume

Syntax as a command:  verify_dump_volume dvname {-control_args}


Function:  checks the validity and readability of a dump volume
produced by the volume dumper subsystem.  Optionally it will also
produce a pathname list of the segments and directories, if known, on
the dump volume.


Arguments:
dvname
   is the name of the dump volume.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   produces a short form list of objects on the dump volume consisting
   only of pathnames.
-input_volume_desc STR
   uses the attach description STR (default attach description is
   tape_mult_ ^a -system).  The volname is inserted at the first
   occurrence of ^a in the attach description.
-long, -lg
   produces a long form list of objects on the dump volume consisting
   of pathname, object type, and other information where applicable.
-stop_vtocx N
   stops the verification process when a VTOCE with octal index N is
   encountered, calls the debug command, and prints a pointer to the
   VTOCE.


Notes:  If no control argument is specified, the entire dump volume is
read and an error count message is printed at the end of the volume.
If read errors occur, the same resynchronization mechanism used by the
volume reloader and volume retriever is used.  If the pathname cannot
be determined, the string "UNKNOWN" is used.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
