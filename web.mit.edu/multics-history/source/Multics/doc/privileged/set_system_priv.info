02/27/85 set_system_priv

Syntax as a command:  set_system_priv privilege_name1
   {...privilege_nameN}


Function:  is used to turn on and off the system privileges that allow
the process to function outside the restrictions of the AIM access
controls.  Whenever the privileges are turned on, the user must
carefully check to ensure that his actions do not accidentally disclose
information that was previously protected by the AIM access controls.

The set_system_priv command is needed only if the site is using the AIM
access controls.


Arguments:

   may be any of a character string which is listed below.


List of character strings:
comm

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
