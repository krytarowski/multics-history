03/27/85 save_history_registers

Syntax as a command:  save_history_registers {state} {-control_args}


Function:  allows a user to save processor history registers upon each
occurrence of a signalable fault in the signalers stack frame.  By
default, the history registers are not saved, and the history register
block in the signalers stack frame is set to all zeros.


Arguments:
state
   can be either "on" or "off."  If state is not specified, it is off.


Control arguments:
-priv
   specifies manipulation of the per-system state by directing the
   state and -print arguments to operate on the per-system history
   register save switch, wired_hardcore_data$global_hregs.  When set,
   this switch causes all processes to save their history registers
   upon each occurrence of a signalable fault in the signalers stack
   frame.  If -priv is not specified, then the state and -print
   arguments operate on pds$save_history_regs, the per-process history
   register save switch of the process executing this command.


-print, -pr
   displays the current state of the history register save switch if
   the state argument is not specified; if the state argument is
   specified, the state of the switch is displayed before the new state
   is applied.


Access required:  When -priv is used, hphcs_ access is required.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
