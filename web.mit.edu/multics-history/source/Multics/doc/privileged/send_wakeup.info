02/27/85 send_wakeup

Syntax as a command:  send_wakeup process_id event_channel
   {event_message}


Function:  sends an IPC wakeup to a process.  It is a command interface
to the hcs_$wakeup subroutine entry point.


Arguments:
process_id
   is a 12-digit octal number specifying the ID of the process that is
   to receive the wakeup.  Leading zeros can be omitted.
event_channel
   is a 24-digit octal number specifying the event channel over which
   the wakeup is to be sent.  Leading zeros can be omitted.
event_message
   is an optional 72-bit event message, given as either a 24-digit
   octal number or an eight-character ASCII string.  The default is all
   zero bits.  Leading zeros or trailing blanks can be omitted.  The
   event message is assumed to be in octal form if it contains only
   octal digits.


Notes:  Nonexistent processes and event channels of invalid format are
diagnosed; however, validly formed but nonexistent event channels are
not diagnosed.

The process_id active function is a convenient way of obtaining a
process id, given a User_id or channel name.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
