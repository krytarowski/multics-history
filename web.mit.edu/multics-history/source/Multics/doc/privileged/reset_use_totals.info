02/27/85 reset_use_totals

Syntax as a command:  reset_use_totals use_totals control


Function:  clears all totals in a month-to-date statistics data base at
the end of a billing period and reloads the list of reporting
categories.


Arguments:
use_totals
   is the pathname of the statistical data base.
control
   is an ASCII file that classifies projects into reporting categories.


Notes:  Each line in the control file is of the form shown below.

      Project_id, reporting category

All projects in the same reporting category are classified together in
the data base by the usage_total program.  Lines beginning with "*" are
ignored.

The last control line in the file must be of the form as shown below.

      other, category title

to provide for the classification of all other projects.  Up to 3258
individual projects (in addition to the "other" control line) and 300
category titles may be specified.


This command is executed by biller.ec with the arguments as shown
below.

      today.use_totals daily_report.control

after a copy of the use_totals segment (containing statistics for the
month just ending) has been saved for historical purposes.  This
command initializes the today.use_totals segment to begin collecting
statistics for the next month.  This is the only time during the month
when the classification of projects into reporting categories may be
changed.  The pathname of the control segment, describing the
classification, must be given, even if the classification is not
changing.


If multiple rate structures are defined at the site, it is recommended
that a separate category (or group of categories) be used for the
projects in each rate structure (i.e., that projects of different rate
structures not be placed in the same category).  The rate structure of
the first project in each category (in the control file) is used for
computing usage statistics for all projects in that category.

If the use_totals segment does not exist, it is created.  This segment
is updated by the system_total and usage_total commands and is input to
the system_daily_report and system_monthly_report commands.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
