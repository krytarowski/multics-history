02/08/85  hp_set_acl, hpsa

Syntax as a command:  hpsa path mode1 User_id1 ...  modeN {User_idN}
   {-control_args}


Function:  manipulates the access control lists (ACLs) of segments,
multisegment files, directories, and gates.  This command operates on
objects whose ring brackets prevent them from being operated on by the
set_acl command.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a segment, multisegment file, directory, or gate.
   If it is -wd or -working_dir, the working directory is assumed.  The
   star convention can be used and applies to either segments and
   multisegment files or directories, depending on the type of mode
   specified in mode1.
modei
   is a valid access mode.  For segments, multisegment files, or gates,
   any or all of the letters rew; for directories, any or all of the
   letters sma with the requirement that if modify is present, status
   must also be present.  Use null, "n" or "" to specify null access.


User_idi
   is an access control name that must be of the form
   Person_id.Project_id.tag.  All ACL entries with matching names
   receive the mode modei.  (For a description of the matching
   strategy, see the Multics Programmer's Reference Manual, Order No.
   AG91.)  If no match is found and all three components are present,
   an entry is added to the ACL.  If the last mode_i has no User_id
   following it, the Person_id of the user and current Project_id are
   assumed.


Control arguments:
(either control argument is used to resolve an ambiguous choice
between segments and directories that occurs only when modei is null
and the star convention is used in path).
-directory, -dr
   specifies that only directories are affected.
-segment, -sm
   specifies that only segments and multisegment files are affected.
   This is the default.


Access required:  To use this command, a system administrator must have
access to the highly privileged gate hphcs_.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
