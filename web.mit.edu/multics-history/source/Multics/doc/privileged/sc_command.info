02/27/85 sc_command

Syntax as a command:  sc_command initializer_command {arguments}


Function:  allows initializer commands to be executed from admin mode.


Notes:  This command is used in exec_coms such as system_start_up.ec
and admin.ec, and in some uses of the send_admin_command (sac) command.
In these cases, the initializer process is executing in admin mode (see
the admin command earlier in this section) and expects normal Multics
commands.  Any initializer commands to be executed in these cases must
be executed by using sc_command.

However, because sc_command is executed from within admin mode (whether
typed by the user or sent via the sac command), the initializer_command
argument cannot be a command that re-enters admin mode (for example,
the exec ["x"] command).  In order to accomplish this, the x command
can be replaced by "ec admin {args}".


Administrators should avoid using the sac command to send initializer
commands that ask questions, because the questions will be asked on the
bootload console.  Use of the answer command solves this problem for
Multics commands sent via sac, but the answer command cannot be used to
supply answers to initializer commands, since most initializer commands
ask their question using a different interface from normal Multics
commands.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
