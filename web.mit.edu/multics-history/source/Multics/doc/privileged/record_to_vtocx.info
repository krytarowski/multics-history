02/27/85 record_to_vtocx

Syntax as a command:  record_to_vtocx pv_name arg1 ...  argN
   record_to_vtocx pv_name -sector sector_arg1 ...  -sector sector_argN


Function:  finds any VTOC entries corresponding to a specified record
number on a storage system volume.


Arguments:
pv_name
   is the name of the physical device.
argi
   is the octal record number.
sector_argi
   is the octal sector number.


Access required:  You need access to the phcs_ gate.


Notes:  Looking for the correct match, this command scans the VTOCEs in
ascending order for each argument; therefore it uses great amounts of
CPU time and requires considerable I/O.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
