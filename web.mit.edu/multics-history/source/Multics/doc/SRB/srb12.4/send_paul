 1.   The   undocumented   procedure   canonicalize_   no  longer
      terminates it's input pointer.

 2.   Exec_com has been modified to accept the literal &CR.

 3.   The subroutine entry point  'null_entry_' has been added to
      the  command 'nothing'.   This will  enable programmers  to
      perform the same function  as calling the command 'nothing'
      without using a name that can easily clash with the name of
      user segments.

 4.   The maximum number of  components in a multi-segment vfile_
      has been raised from 900 to 1250.

 5.   The   short   name   'dfi'    has   been   added   to   the
      'display_forms_info' command.

 6.   The   working_dir,  get_pathname,  and   equal_name  active
      functions  now return  quoted strings.   Users may  have to
      modify exec_coms  to no longer use the  double vertical bar
      convention  (   ||[...]  )  to  suppress   active  function
      re-evaluation.

A- 1. Dates are  calculated using the "Pope  Gregory XIII" method
      (after  Oct 4,  1582).  The  full (normally  4 digit)  year
      instead of the  partial (1 or 2 digit) year  is used in the
      header for the small calendars.

B- 1. The  "c_compile" command  has been  modified to  painlessly
      locate the other components  of the c_compiler.  Users will
      no  longer have  to change  their search  rules or forcibly
      initiate these programs (cop, ccom, le and main_).

C- 1. All user data input or output through LINUS will be rounded
      to the precision of the target before storage or display.


_M_r_d_s

D- 1. MRDS will  now complain on attempts to  open databases that
      require  the use  of Data_Management  if Data_Management is
      not available.


_P_A_S_C_A_L

E- 1. Pascal's round  operator now correctly rounds  real numbers
      of the form -x.5 to the value -(x+1).o, rather than -x.0 as
      was done before.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
