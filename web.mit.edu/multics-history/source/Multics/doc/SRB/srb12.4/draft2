 1.   [MCR 7965].. The range of autobaud rate detection for ASYNC
      terminal  connections has  been changed.   Prevously it was
      between 110 and 1200 baud.  It now operates between 300 and
      9600 baud.

 2.   [MCR  7993]..  Added  the  following  terminal  types (with
      alternate names)to the installed terminal type table:
                VERSATERM220_80C_36L (VERSATERM_80C_36L)
                VERSATERM220_80C_36L_OFLOW
      (VERSATERM220_80C_36L_OFLOW)
                VERSATERM220_102C_36L (VERSATERM_102C_36L)
                VERSATERM220_102C_36L_OFLOW
      (VERSATERM_102C_36L_OFLOW)   These   terminal   types  were
      developed  to  handle  usage   of  the  Versaterm  terminal
      emulatoe on the different Macintosh PCs with various screen
      sizes.  The following alternate names were added.
                VERSATERM_132C_24L to VERSATERM220_132C_24L
                VERSATERM_132C_24LOFLOW                        to
      VERSATERM220_132C_24LOFLOW  Corrected   the  "jump  scroll"
      sequence  in the  initial string  for the VERSATERM220_132c
      terminal type.  Changed the ^pl mode for TEK4023 to pl23.

 3.   [MCR  7993].. Added HB_LW_PRINTER_FORMS_BASE  terminal type
      for  use by  a driver  processing requests  using the forms
      option to  a HB Laserwriter.  Added DD8260  (by Delta Data)
      series of terminal types.  This  is part of the support for
      horizontal scrolling in Emacs.

_B_C_E

A- 1. [MCR 7811].. Modified the BCE restore request to zero clear
      the  unused area  at the  end  of  the VTOC  region on  the
      physical volume being restored,  before the restore begins.
      This is to avoid the possibility of having non-zero data in
      this  area that  would later  be interpreted  as an invalid
      VTOCE.

A- 2. [MCR  7796].. Added  an  option  for pre-defining  the data
      needed to  locate the Root Physical Volume  (RPV) at system
      boot time.  This data can  be placed in the hardcore.header
      segment and subsequently placed  on the Multics System Tape
      (MST)  by generate_mst.   See  the  description of  the new
      "default_rpv_data"  minor keyword in  generate_mst.info for
      more details.

A- 3. [MCR  7795].. Added  an option  for pre-defining  a default
      time zone,  for use early  in the system  bootload process.
      This  default data  can  be  placed in  the hardcore.header
      segment and subsequently placed  on the Multics System Tape
      (MST)  by generate_mst.   See  the  description of  the new
      "default_time_zone" minor keyword  in generate_mst.info for
      more details.

B- 1. [MCR 7870].. The console beeper will no longer be turned on
      when  rcp_init is unable  to read the  options from a  tape
      handler during system initialization.


_I_n_i_t_i_a_l_i_z_e_r _R_e_q_u_e_s_t

C- 1. [MCR  7880]..  Added  new  initializer  (Operator) request,
      list_vol_attachment  (lvat),  is  now  available.   It will
      display a list of the current attachment(s) to a LV, set of
      LVs or all the LVs that have attachments.

D- 1. [MCR 7969].. Modified the new_user command to time_lock the
      password of a user.  A user will be immediately bumped from
      the system unless they have the "nobump" user attribute.

D- 2. [MCR 7760]..  Modified the reset_soos command  to reset the
      security_out_of_service  switch  on  segments  as  well  as
      directories.


_O_P_E_R_A_T_O_R _I_N_T_E_R_F_A_C_E _S_O_F_T_W_A_R_E

_C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s

F- 1. [MCR  7827].. Added a  new control argument,  -no_trim, for
      use  with  the  query/response  command/af.   The  -no_trim
      arguement will cause query/response questions which contain
      trailing spaces to not be trimmed.

F- 2. [MCR  7817].. Modified  dump_segment and  ring_zero_dump to
      display data as PL/1 structures  similar to the probe value
      request.

F- 3. [MCR 7879]..  Modified the canonicalize command  to support
      canonicalization of MSFs.

F- 4. [MCR 7797].. Modified add_search_rules and add_search_paths
      commands   to   accept   the   -inhibit_error   (-ihe)  and
      -no_inhibit_error   (-nihe)   control   arguements,   which
      determine   whether  to    print  warning   messages  about
      nonexistent  pathnames  and  paths  already  in  the search
      rules/search  list.   The   add_search_paths  commands  now
      accepts the  -force (-fc) control argument  to allow adding
      paths already  in the search  list to new  positions in the
      list.   -no_force (-nfc)  has been  added to  override this
      control  argument.   The  delete_search_paths  command  now
      recognizes the  short forms of the  pathname keywords (viz:
      -wd, -pd, -rd, -hd).

F- 5. [MCR 7822]..  The search rules  commands (add_search_rules,
      set_search_rules,  delete_search_rules, print_search_rules)
      are   now   obsolete,   though   they   will   be  retained
      indefinitely.    In  their   place,  the   search  facility
      (add_search_paths,  set_search_paths,  delete_search_paths,
      print_search_paths) now manipulate  the search rules (using
      the  "linker" search list).   The search facility  also now
      keeps track  of pathname by UID, so  multiple references to
      an entry in a search list need not be by the same name.

F- 6. [MCR  7686].. Provided  users with  the ability  to request
      line-numbered printouts from the  I/O SysDaemons by the new
      control argument  -number, -nb to  the enter_output_request
      command.  Line-numbers will appear on the output as they do
      from the print command.  See the online help files for more
      information.

F- 7. [MCR  7804].. Modified  the print_terminal_type  command to
      accept  a starname  option  of  the specific  terminal type
      names  to print.   This has  caused an  incompatible syntax
      change.  The  displat_tty command now allows  starnames for
      either  the  -terminal_type  or  -table  options.   It also
      allows a like definition to be completely expanded.

F- 8. [MCR 7753]..  The -interpret (-int, -it)  and -no_interpret
      (-nint,  -nit)   arguments  have  been  removed   from  the
      disk_queue command.

F- 9. [MCR  7836]..   Added  capability  for   the  virtual_entry
      argument to display_entry_point_dcl,  and the virtual_entry
      data item  in the pl1.dcl declare  file to be given  in the
      form "entry" or "entry$entry",  as in "ask_" or "ask_$ask_"
      for an equal match.  See the online help file.

F-10. [MCR 7868].. Modified basic  compiler to associate severity
      levels with error messages.   The severity command will now
      work with basic.

F-11. [MCR 7832]..  Added a new  control argument, -data,  to the
      value_get command  to return the uninterpreted  contents of
      data-type  values from a  value segment.  These  values can
      then be  routed into a  temporary segment for  display with
      the   dump_segment  command   or  some   other  use.    See
      value_get.info for details.

F-12. [MCR 7874]..  Added the new command  "set_lisp_temp_dir" to
      specify a directory for temporary segments created during a
      lisp environment  such as emacs or  lisp_compiler.  Any new
      lisp temp  segs will be placed in  the specified directory.
      Existing temp segs will not  be moved to the new directory.
      Temporary segs placed in a directory other than the process
      dir   will  be   preserved  across   processes  and  system
      interruptions.  While this is  useful for debugging and for
      holding  large temp  segs, care  should be  taken to delete
      obsolete  segs  as  each  process  will  create new copies.
      Using a  nonvolatile directory for lisp temp  segs does not
      mean  that the  lisp environment  is restartable  in a  new
      process.

F-13. [MCR  7867].. Modified display_disk_label  and display_pvte
      to  display  disk  partition  first  records  and  sizes in
      decimal and octal.



Contents of MR12.2             3-4                        SRB12.1


F-14. [MCR  7867]..  Modified  list_vols  argument  processing to
      allow the -rec_used/-rec_left and  the -pv/-lv arguments to
      override one another.  Changed the switch_on and switch_off
      commands to set a pre-entry access audit switch.

F-15. [MCR 7881].. Accesses may now  be audited for specific file
      system  entry's by  turning  on  the entry's  audit switch.
      This  operation requires   access to  the system_privilege_
      gate.

F-16. [MCR 7937].. Added the  -state_date control argument to the
      manage_volume_pool set operation.

F-17. [MCR  7849]..  Added  the  -auth,  -home_dir, -no_start_up,
      -process_overseer,  and  -ring  control  arguments  to  the
      enter_abs_request    command.    The   command    and   the
      enter_abs_request_  subroutine  will  use  exec_com  search
      paths to locate the absin file, if only a file entryname is
      given.

F-18. [MCR  7861].. Added the  copy_liveproc command to  dump the
      contents of an active process directory, for display by the
      analyze_multics (azm) subsystem.

F-19. [MCR 7841]..  Added a new version (1.2)  of kermit.  Kermit
      will transmit  and receive multisegment files,  and support
      extended packet  length.  See the kermit  info segments for
      more details.

F-20. [MCR   7913]..   Added    a   new   command/active_function
      "request_info"   (rqi)   to    return   specific   detailed
      information  about  any  request  queued  in  the absentee,
      output, retrieval, imft or any of the specific request type
      message queues.   Added the -forms control  argument to the
      list_abs_requests (lar) command.

F-21. [MCR 7778].. Modified the abbrev  .use request to no longer
      expand  beginning_of_line abbrevs  that match  the pathname
      string.

F-22. [MCR  7766]..  Added  the  -all_entrypoints  (-aep) control
      argument to  the help rest request, to  print all remaining
      information  for  the  rest  of   the  entry  points  of  a
      subroutine info segment.  Added a -list_enrty_points (-lep)
      control argument to the help command, to list all the entry
      points of a subroutine info  segment.  The entry point list
      will no  longer be displayed with each  entry point.  Added
      the  list_entry_points (lep)  request which  lists all  the
      entry  points  of  a  subroutine  info  segment.   Added  a
      -case_sensitive  (-cs) control  arugment to  the search and
      section requests, and  to the help command to  be used with
      either -section  or -search.  The default  will be non-case
      sensitive.   Added the   list_requests and  help responses,
      which display a brief explanation of help responses.

F-23. [MCR  7839].. Add stack  features to the  change_wdir (cwd)
      command.   Change  print_wdir  (pwd)  and  working_dir (wd)
      commands/active function  to optionally print or  return an
      entire stack or a stack portion.

F-24. [MCR  7985].. Deleted  the find_common_acl_names_  command.
      This  command has been  replaced by the  match_acl internal
      procedure of the acl_commands_.

F-25. [MCR   8008]..   Added   new   control   arguments  to  the
      list_sub_tree commands to make it more versatile.


_D_a_t_e_/_T_i_m_e _S_o_f_t_w_a_r_e

G- 1. [MCR  7815]..  Modified  the   date/time  argument  to  the
      date_deleter command.  It may now contain a leading hyphen,
      to express a time as -12hours.


_M_a_i_l_/_M_e_s_s_a_g_e _F_a_c_i_l_i_t_y

H- 1. [MCR 7842]..  Changed the extended mail  system (read_mail,
      print_mail and send_mail) and emacs rmail to use the search
      list  named  "mlsys"  to  locate  mailboxes,  saveboxes and
      mailing lists.  The default search paths for mlsys are -wd,
      -hd    and    >udd>[person    proj]>[person   name]>[person
      name].mlsys.  Only free standing mailing lists that are not
      archive  components will be  located using the  search path
      facility.

_P_r_o_c_e_s_s _E_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t

I- 1. [MCR  7999].. Modified the  calculation of memory  units to
      decrease  the  differences  between  units  measured during
      light system  load versus heavier loads.   This change will
      make memory  units a more repeatable and  useful measure of
      process paging.


_P_L_/_1

J- 1. [MCR 7724]..  Modified PL/1 to now  recognize that internal
      static options  (constant) variables have  constant values,
      and to  allow these variables  in many new  cointexts where
      previously only literal constants were allowed.

                          go to TYPE (star_entries.type);

                TYPE (STAR_SEGMENT):

                          go to NEXT_ENTRY;

                TYPE (STAR_LINK):

                          go to NEXT_ENTRY;

                TYPE (star_directory):

J- 2. [MCR 7914].. Modified PL/1 to  now accept the -no_prefix to
      the PL/1 compiler.


_S_u_b_r_o_u_t_i_n_e_s

K- 1. [MCR 7770].. Modified hcs_$reset_ips_mask  to reset the IPS
      mask   only    to   values   returned   as    old_mask   by
      hcs_$set_ips_mask.  Such mask values contain a control flag
      in the mask.  This avoids leaving IPS signals masked if the
      user quits  after a cleanup handler is  established to call
      hcs_$reset_ips_mask   but   before   hcs_$set_ips_mask  was
      called.

K- 2. [MCR 7845].. Modified programs that reference the disk_stat
      segment to allow that segment to become a multisegment file
      if statistics  are recorded for more  directories than will
      fit in a segment.

K- 3. [MCR 7873].. Added a pad field and changed the order of the
      fields in help_cis_args_.incl.pl1.

L- 1. [MCR  7807]..  Deleted  the  compose  device support module
      bound_vip7801_dsm_  because it  has been  inoperative since
      MR9.0.


_C _L_a_n_g_u_a_g_e

M- 1. [MCR  8011].. Added  support to  the C  compiler to  handle
      common arguments  that are used  in many C  programs.  This
      will  aid  the  user  who   is  porting  this  software  by
      increasing the chance of success.

M- 2. [MCR 7940]..
       The AT&T System V LINT command has been ported to Multics.
      LINT
       is a C program checker,  which is much more stringent than
      the
       C compiler.

M- 3. [MCR 7941]..
       THE AT&T System V Release 2.0 MAKE command has been ported
      to
       Multics.  Make maintains,  updates, and regenerates groups
      of programs.

M- 4. [MCR 7971]..
       The Multics C include file  varargs.h has been modified to
      be compatible
       with System V varargs.h.   This is an incompatible change.
      Multics programs
       written to use the older version of varargs.h will require
      changes to
       remove  the extra  level of  indirection or  be recompiled
      using
       "-def Multics_Obsolete_Varargs".

M- 5. [MCR 7952]..  Probe can now be  used on C programs.   The C
      program  should be  compiled (using  'cc') with  the -table
      (-tb) control argument.


_L_I_N_U_S

N- 1. [MCR  7844]..  Added  new  control  arguments  to the LINUS
      store,  store_from_data_file,  write,  and  write_data_file
      requests  to control the  printing of warning  messages and
      progress    messages.     The    -warning/-no_warning   and
      -trace/-no_trace arguments control these messages.

_M_O_W_S_E

O- 1. [MCR  7853].. Modified  the PC   MOWSE command  to cause  a
      communications  connection to  be disconnected  by default,
      unlike  the previous  version  which  provided no  means by
      which   a  connection   could  be   broken.   The   default
      disconnection  can  be  avoided  by  providing  a  new "/H"
      control argument to the PC MOWSE command.

O- 2. [MCR 7936]..  Modified MOWSE to correctly  support the mark
      and space parity options for the /P control argument.

O- 3. [MCR 7787]..  Modified btf to maintain a  queue of transfer
      requests with priority levels (1 - 4) and service the queue
      automatically.   This will allow  the user to  specify more
      than 2  requests at a  time.  (as was  the restriction with
      the previous implementation).

O- 4. [MCR    7787]..    Modified    the    "recover_store"   and
      "recover_fetch"  directives to  be condensed  into a single
      "recover" directive requiring no other arguments.  bft will
      then   automatically  recover  interrupted   transfers  and
      continue with the requested entries in the queue.

O- 5. [MCR  7787]..  The  command  "bft"  with  no arguments will
      display a listing of requests in the queue.

O- 6. [MCR 7787].. The "cancel" directive  will allow the user to
      remove requests from the queue.

O- 7. [MCR  7787]..  Added  the  "-file_type  {binary  |  ascii}"
      control argument  to the "fetch" and  "store" directives to
      allow the  user to specify  whether or not  <CR><NL> - <NL>
      conversions will be performed.

O- 8. [MCR 7787]..  Added the "-queue N" control  argument to the
      "fetch" and "store" directives to specify transfer priority
      of the request (1 - 4 with 1 being the highest priority).

O- 9. [MCR 7787].. Starname expansion  provision will be accepted
      by the "store"  and "fetch" directives to allow  the user a
      more dynamic means of transfer request specification.

O-10. [MCR 7897]..  A number of  new features are  being added to
      WSTERM to increase its  functionality and usability.  These
      include  editing,   auditing,  help  and   command  history
      capabilities.
        /A - specifies the name of the audit file to write to for
      file audit.
        /P - specifies  the printer card (0 - 3)  to use for line
      printing.
                                    Changes  to WSTERM  1) A  new
      keyboard input routine will be  added which will allow some
      EMACS-like  editing capabilities  on keyboard  input before
      sending a line  to the host.  2) Input going  to and coming
      from the host  will be trapped by WSTERM to  allow the data
      to  be stored  to a  file  and/or  printed as  it is  being
      displayed.  3) Lines  of input will be saved  in a circular
      buffer  each time  they are   entered to  allow them  to be
      retrieved  later.   4)  Routines  for  saving and restoring
      screen  contents to and  from a local  buffer will allow  a
      help  screen   to  be  displayed  without   disturbing  the
      displaying of terminal/host dialog.  5) Routines for saving
      and  restoring screen  contents will  also allow background
      messages  to be displayed  on a screen  of its own  without
      disturbing the  displaying of terminal/host dialog.   6) In
      addition  to  signaling  the  presence  of  background  and
      foreground  messages, the  bottom line  of the  screen will
      display  the current  WSTERM modes.   7) The  control-S key
      will  be used to  stop the screen  from scrolling.  8)  The
      BREAK, ^@ or ^2 key, and the DEL key will be made to send a
      break   signal,   nul   character   and   delete  character
      respectively.

O-11. [MCR7986]..   The  Asynchronous/Non-Edit   WSTERM  terminal
      emulation mode is  beingreplaced with an Asynchrounous/Edit
      mode.   This contains   considerable keyboard  and terminal
      enhancements, thus making the Non-Edit mode obsolete.





_E_M_A_C_S

P- 1. [MCR  7851].. Extended the  EMACS editor to  support direct
      input  and display  of 8-bit  characters.  In  order to use
      this feature,  the terminal must be able  to generate 8-bit
      codes  and display  graphics corresponding  to 8-bit  codes
      received.








Contents of MR12.2             3-10                       SRB12.1


P- 2. [MCR  7851].. Modified  EMACS terminal  controller function
      DCTL-init must set the LISP variable DCTL-extended-ascii to
      non-nil.  Also, the TTF entry  for the terminal must define
      an   output_conversion  table    that  defines   the  8-bit
      characters that can be  directly displayed by the terminal.
      See the EMACS Extension Writer's Guide (CJ52) for details.

P- 3. [MCR  8002].. Modified EMACS  to support the  following new
      terminal types:
                VERSATERM_80C_36L, VERSATERM_80C_36L_OFLOW
                VERSATERM_102C_36L, VERSATERM_102C_36L_OFLOW
                VERSATERM220_80C_36L, VERSATERM220_80C_36L_OFLOW
                VERSATERM220_102C_36L,
      VERSATERM220_102C_36L_OFLOW EMACS will use the current line
      and page lengths from the tty_ mode string to determine how
      large  a  screen  the  Versaterm  Terminal  Emulator on the
      Macintosh is actually supporting.



_E_x_e_c_u_t_i_v_e _M_a_i_l

Q- 1. [MCR  7818].. Added new  field labeled "Reply-to:"  for the
      header  built by  the xmail   send and  reply editors.   By
      editing this field, users may  now designate a recipient of
      replies.  The default recipient is the sender.




_F_O_R_T_R_A_N


_M_R_D_S

R- 1. [MCR 7840].. Added  a mrds search list named  "mrds" with a
      default  search  path  of  "-working_dir".   The  following
      commands and subroutines use the mrds search list to search
      for   mrds   databases.    adjust_mrds_db,  copy_mrds_data,
      create_mrds_dm_include,create_mrds_dm_table,
      display_mrds_db_access,         display_mrds_db_population,
      display_mrds_db_status,            display_mrds_db_version,
      display_mrds_dm,        display_mrds_dsm,        mrds_call,
      quiesce_mrds_db,     secure_mrds_db,    unpopulate_mrds_db,
      restructure_mrds_db (ready request),  linus (open request),
      dsl_$open,     dsl_$get_path_info,     msmi_$open_submodel,
      mmi_$get_secured_state,             mmi_$get_authorization,
      mmi_$open_model, mmi_$quiesce_db and mmi_$unquiesce_db.

R- 2. [7903].. Modified MRDS to report syntax and semantic errors
      in   selection    expressions   via   a    new   condition,
      mrds_se_error_.   The default   handler for  this condition
      formats the selection expression  that caused the error and
      displays  it on  the error_output  switch along  with other
      diagnostic information.

R- 3. [7903]..  Modified  MRDS  to  no  longer  enforce the rigid
      parentheses  rules  of  the  past.   Parentheses  are still
      allowed,  but   are  only  needed  to   establish  operator
      precedence.

R- 4. [7903]..  Added  a  new  command,  set_mrds_options.   This
      provision  gives users  a finer  control over  the way MRDS
      operates in their process.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
