Highlights                     2-3                        SRB12.2









                            SECTION 3


                        CONTENTS OF MR12.2






_C_O_M_M_U_N_I_C_A_T_I_O_N_S _S_Y_S_T_E_M _S_O_F_T_W_A_R_E

 1.   The  range of  autobaud rate  detection for  ASYNC terminal
      connections  has been  changed.  Previously  it was between
      110 and  1200 baud.  It  now operates between  300 and 9600
      baud.

 2.   Changed the  TTF to include special  character sequences of
      up to  15 characters instead  of the current  limitation of
      three.  The current system TTF  must be converted using the
      change  cv_ttf  command  and  the  resulting  TTT  must  be
      installed.  All  user-written TTFs must also  be recompiled
      before use.  The set_ttt_path  command will report an error
      advising  user to  recompile the  TTF if  their version  is
      incorrect.   Although  the  size  of  the special charaters
      structure  has  changed,  users   of  the  set_special  and
      get_special control orders should not be affected since the
      code is upward compatible.  However, any other users of the
      c_chars  structure may  be affected  since the  size of the
      character array has been changed.

 3.   Added the following terminal types (with alternate names)to
      the installed terminal type table:

                VERSATERM220_80C_36L (VERSATERM_80C_36L)
                VERSATERM220_80C_36L_OFLOW (VERSATERM220_80C_36L_OFLOW)
                VERSATERM220_102C_36L (VERSATERM_102C_36L)
                VERSATERM220_102C_36L_OFLOW (VERSATERM_102C_36L_OFLOW)

      These terminal types were developed  to handle usage of the
      Versaterm terminal emulator on  the different Macintosh PCs
      with  various screen  sizes.  Corrected  the "jump  scroll"
      sequence  in the  initial string  for the VERSATERM220_132c
      terminal type.  Changed the ^pl mode for TEK4023 to pl23.

 4.   Added HB_LW_PRINTER_FORMS_BASE  terminal type for use  by a
      driver  processing requests  using  the  forms option  to a
      Honeywell Bull  Laserwriter.  Added DD8260 (by  Delta Data)
      series of terminal types.  This  is part of the support for
      horizontal scrolling in Emacs.


_O_P_E_R_A_T_I_N_G _S_Y_S_T_E_M _S_O_F_T_W_A_R_E


_I_/_O _D_a_e_m_o_n _S_o_f_t_w_a_r_e

A- 1. Added  enhancements   to  I/O  daemon  software   to  allow
      attachment  of laser  printers as  remote devices.  Initial
      implememtation is for the  Honeywell Bull Model 80 printer.
      Among the  enhancements are print orientation  on the page,
      font  selection, site-defined  head and  tail sheets,  etc.
      Defaults have  been chosen for  the new features  such that
      the  current I/O  daemon tables   source file  may be  used
      as-is.   The  addition  of  the  new  features  has  caused
      incompatible  changes in  the compiled  I/O daemon  tables.
      The sites  current tables must be recompiled  using the new
      version of the iod_tables_compiler.


_B_C_E

B- 1. Modified the  BCE restore request to zero  clear the unused
      area at the  end of the VTOC region on  the physical volume
      being  restored, before  the  restore  begins.  This  is to
      avoid the possibility of having  non-zero data in this area
      that would later be interpreted as an invalid VTOCE.


_S_y_s_t_e_m _I_n_i_t_i_a_l_i_z_a_t_i_o_n

C- 1. Added an option for pre-defining  the data needed to locate
      the Root  Physical Volume (RPV) at system  boot time.  This
      data  can  be  placed  in  the  hardcore.header segment and
      subsequently  placed on  the Multics  System Tape  (MST) by
      generate_mst.    See    the   description   of    the   new
      default_rpv_data  minor  keyword  in  generate_mst.info for
      more details.

C- 2. Added an  option for pre-defining a default  time zone, for
      use  early in  the system  bootload process.   This default
      data  can  be  placed  in  the  hardcore.header segment and
      subsequently  placed on  the Multics  System Tape  (MST) by
      generate_mst.    See    the   description   of    the   new
      default_time_zone  minor keyword  in generate_mst.info  for
      more details.

C- 3. The  console  beeper  will  no  longer  be  turned  on when
      rcp_init is unable to read  the options from a tape handler
      during system initialization.


_I_n_i_t_i_a_l_i_z_e_r _C_o_m_m_a_n_d

D- 1. Added     a    new    initializer     (Operator)    command
      list_lv_attachments,  llva.   It  will  display  a  list of
      processes currently attached to a LV, set of LVs or all the
      LVs that have attachments.


_A_D_M_I_N_I_S_T_R_A_T_I_O_N _C_O_M_M_A_N_D_S

E- 1. Modified the new_user command  to time_lock the password of
      a user.  A user who is  logged in when the time_lock is set
      for  his/her password will  be immediately bumped  from the
      system unless they have the "nobump" user attribute.

E- 2. Modified programs  that reference the disk_stat  segment to
      allow  that  segment  to  become  a  multisegment  file  if
      statistics are recorded for  more directories than will fit
      in a segment.


_M_A_I_N_T_E_N_A_N_C_E _S_O_F_T_W_A_R_E

F- 1. Modified    the   reset_soos    command   to    reset   the
      security_out_of_service  switch  on  segments  as  well  as
      directories.


_C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s

G- 1. Added  new audit  keyword to  the switch_on  and switch_off
      commands.   Accesses may now  be audited for  specific file
      system  entry's by  turning  on  the entry's  audit switch.
      This  operation requires   access to  the system_privilege_
      gate.

G- 2. Added      the     -auth,      -home_dir,     -no_start_up,
      -process_overseer,  and  -ring  control  arguments  to  the
      enter_abs_request    command.    The   command    and   the
      enter_abs_request_  subroutine  will  use  exec_com  search
      paths to locate the absin file, if only a file entryname is
      given.

G- 3. Added a new version (1.2)  of kermit.  Kermit will transmit
      and receive multisegment files, and support extended packet
      length.  See the kermit info segments for more details.




Contents of MR12.2             3-3                        SRB12.2


G- 4. Added  the  new  control  argument  -number,  -nb,  to  the
      enter_output_request  command  to  provide  users  with the
      ability  to request line-numbered  printouts.  Line-numbers
      will  appear  on  the  output  as  they  do  from the print
      command.  See the online help files for more information.

G- 5. Add  memory  features  to  the  change_wdir,  cwd, command.
      Change    print_wdir,    pwd,    and    working_dir,    wd,
      commands/active  functions to   optionally print  or return
      prior working directories that are on the memory stack.

G- 6. Modified dump_segment and ring_zero_dump to display data as
      PL/1 structures similar to the probe value request.

G- 7. Modified    the    canonicalize    command    to    support
      canonicalization of MSFs.

G- 8. The     search     rules     commands     add_search_rules,
      set_search_rules,          delete_search_rules,         and
      print_search_rules  are now  obsolete, though  they will be
      retained indefinitely.  In their place, the search facility
      now manipulates the search  rules using the "linker" search
      list.  The search facility also now keeps track of pathname
      by UID, so multiple references to an entry in a search list
      need not be by the same name.

G- 9. Modified  the  print_terminal_type   command  to  accept  a
      starname  option of  the  specific  terminal type  names to
      print.  This has caused an incompatible syntax change.  The
      display_ttt  command now  allows starnames  for either  the
      -terminal_type  or -table options.   It also allows  a like
      definition to be completely expanded.

G-10. Added  a  new  control  argument,  -data,  to the value_get
      command to  return the uninterpreted contents  of data-type
      values  from a  value segment.   These values  can then  be
      routed  into  a  temporary  segment  for  display  with the
      dump_segment command or some other use.  See value_get.info
      for details.

G-11. Added the command set_lisp_temp_dir  to specify a directory
      for temporary segments created during a lisp environment by
      commands such as emacs or lisp_compiler.  Any new lisp temp
      segs will  be placed in the  specified directory.  Existing
      temp  segs  will  not  be   moved  to  the  new  directory.
      Temporary segs placed in a directory other than the process
      dir   will  be   preserved  across   processes  and  system
      interruptions.  While this is  useful for debugging and for
      holding  large temp  segs, care  should be  taken to delete
      obsolete  segs  as  each  process  will  create new copies.
      Using a  nonvolatile directory for lisp temp  segs does not
      mean  that the  lisp environment  is restartable  in a  new
      process.

G-12. Modified  display_disk_label  and  display_pvte  to display
      disk  partition  first  records  and  sizes  in decimal and
      octal.

G-13. Modified  list_vols   argument  processing  to   allow  the
      -rec_used/-rec_left and  the -pv/-lv arguments  to override
      one another.

G-14. Added   the    -state_date   control   argument    to   the
      manage_volume_pool set operation.

G-15. Added  the copy_liveproc  command.  This  new command dumps
      the contents of an active process directory, for display by
      the analyze_multics, azm, subsystem.

G-16. Added the request_info, rqi, new command/active function to
      return  specified information  about any  request queued in
      the  absentee,  output,  retrieval,  imft  or  any  of  the
      specific  request type  message queues.   Added the  -forms
      control argument to the list_abs_requests, lar, command.

G-17. Modified  the  abbrev  .use  request  to  no  longer expand
      beginning_of_line abbrevs that match the pathname string.

G-18. Added the  -all_entrypoints, -aep, control argument  to the
      help rest  request, to print all  remaining information for
      the rest of the entry  points of a subroutine info segment.
      Added a  -list_entry_points, -lep, control argument  to the
      help command, to list all  the entry points of a subroutine
      info  segment.  The  entry point   list will  no longer  be
      displayed    with   each     entry   point.     Added   the
      list_entry_points, lep,  request which lists all  the entry
      points   of   a   subroutine   info   segment.    Added   a
      -case_sensitive,  -cs, control  argument to  the search and
      section requests, and  to the help command to  be used with
      either -section  or -search.  The default  will be non-case
      sensitive.   Added the   list_requests and  help responses,
      which display a brief explanation of help responses.

G-19. Deleted  the find_common_acl_names_ command.   This command
      has  been replaced by  the match_acl internal  procedure of
      the acl_commands_.

G-20. Added new  control arguments to the  list_sub_tree commands
      to make it more versatile.

G-21. Added a  new control argument,  -no_trim, for use  with the
      query/response   command/active  function.    The  -no_trim
      argument will cause  query/response questions which contain
      trailing spaces to not be trimmed.





Contents of MR12.2             3-5                        SRB12.2


G-22. Added  the  control  arguments  -inhibit_error,  -ihe,  and
      -no_inhibit_error, -nihe, to the where_search_paths command
      and  active function.  The  -ihe control argument  causes a
      null  string to be  returned rather than  an error when  no
      matching entry is found.  The -nihe control argument is the
      default.

G-23. Modified add_search_rules and  add_search_paths commands to
      accept  the  -inhibit_error,  -ihe,  and -no_inhibit_error,
      -nihe, control arguments, which  determine whether to print
      warning  messages  about  nonexistent  pathnames  and paths
      already  in the search  rules/search list.  The  default is
      -nihe.

      The add_search_paths  command now accepts the  -force, -fc,
      control  argument  to  allow  adding  paths  already in the
      search list to new positions in the list.  -no_force, -nfc,
      has been added to override this control argument.

      The  delete_search_paths command  now recognizes  the short
      forms of the pathname keywords (e.g., -wd, -pd, -rd, -hd).

G-24. Removed  the  -interpret   (-int,  -it)  and  -no_interpret
      (-nint, -nit) arguments from the disk_queue command.

G-25. Changed display_entry_point_dcl to treat virtual entries of
      the  form  "entry"  or   "entry$entry"  (as  in  "ask_"  or
      "ask_$ask_") as equivalent.  See the online help file.

H- 1. Modified  the   date/time  argument  to   the  date_deleter
      command.  It may now contain a leading hyphen, to express a
      time as -12hours.

I- 1. Changed the extended mail system (read_mail, print_mail and
      send_mail)  and emacs  rmail to  use the  search list named
      "mlsys" to  locate mailboxes, saveboxes and  mailing lists.
      The  default  search  paths  for  mlsys  are  -wd,  -hd and
      >udd>[person proj]>[person name]>[person name].mlsys.  Only
      free standing mailing lists that are not archive components
      will be located using the search path facility.

_P_r_o_c_e_s_s _E_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t

J- 1. Modified  the calculation of  memory units to  decrease the
      differences between units measured during light system load
      versus heavier loads.  This change will make memory units a
      more repeatable and useful measure of process paging.


_P_L_/_1

K- 1. Modified PL/1 to now recognize that internal static options
      (constant)  variables have  constant values,  and to  allow
      these variables in many  new contexts where previously only
      literal constants were allowed.

                          go to TYPE (star_entries.type);

                TYPE (STAR_SEGMENT):

                          go to NEXT_ENTRY;

                TYPE (STAR_LINK):

                          go to NEXT_ENTRY;

                TYPE (star_directory):

K- 2. Modified  PL/1 to  now accept  the -no_prefix  to the  PL/1
      compiler.


_S_u_b_r_o_u_t_i_n_e_s

L- 1. Modified hcs_$reset_ips_mask to reset  the IPS mask only to
      values  returned as   old_mask by  hcs_$set_ips_mask.  Such
      mask  values contain  a control   flag in  the mask.   This
      avoids leaving IPS signals masked if the user quits after a
      cleanup handler is  established to call hcs_$reset_ips_mask
      but before hcs_$set_ips_mask was called.

L- 2. Added a  pad field and changed  the order of the  fields in
      help_cis_args_.incl.pl1.

N- 1. Deleted     the    compose     device    support     module
      bound_vip7801_dsm_  because it  has been  inoperative since
      MR9.0.


_C _L_a_n_g_u_a_g_e

O- 1. Added support to the C  compiler to handle common arguments
      that are used  in many C programs.  This will  aid the user
      who is  porting this software  by increasing the  chance of
      success.

O- 2. The AT&T System V LINT  command has been ported to Multics.
      LINT is a  C program checker, which is  much more stringent
      than the C compiler.

O- 3. THE AT&T System V Release  2.0 MAKE command has been ported
      to  Multics.   Make  maintains,  updates,  and  regenerates
      groups of programs.

O- 4. The Multics  C include file varargs.h has  been modified to
      be  compatible  with  System   V  varargs.h.   This  is  an
      incompatible change.   Multics programs written to  use the
      older version  of varargs.h will require  changes to remove
      the extra level of indirection or be recompiled using "-def
      Multics_Obsolete_Varargs".

O- 5. Probe can now be used on  C programs.  The C program should
      be  compiled (using  'cc')  with  the -table,  -tb, control
      argument.


_F_a_s_t

P- 1. Modified the fast  subsystem to query the user  when a quit
      request is issued without  previously saving changes.  This
      will prevent unintentional loss of changes.


_L_I_N_U_S_, _V_e_r_s_i_o_n _4_._5

Q- 1. Added   new   control   arguments   to   the  LINUS  store,
      store_from_data_file,  write, and  write_data_file requests
      to  control the printing  of warning messages  and progress
      messages.    The  -warning,   -no_warning  (-no_warn)   and
      -progress,  -no_progress  (-npg)  arguments  control  these
      messages.

_M_O_W_S_E

R- 1. Modified  the PC  MOWSE command  to cause  a communications
      connection  to  be  disconnected  by  default,  unlike  the
      previous  version  which  provided  no  means  by  which  a
      connection could be broken.   The default disconnection can
      be avoided by providing a  new "/H" control argument to the
      PC MOWSE command.

R- 2. Modified  MOWSE to  correctly  support  the mark  and space
      parity options for the /P control argument.

R- 3. Modified bft to maintain a  queue of transfer requests with
      priority   levels   (1   -   4)   and   service  the  queue
      automatically.   This will allow  the user to  specify more
      than 2  requests at a  time.  (as was  the restriction with
      the previous implementation).

R- 4. Modified the bft recover_store and recover_fetch directives
      to be  condensed into a single  recover directive requiring
      no  other arguments.   bft will  then automatically recover
      interrupted  transfers  and  continue  with  the  requested
      entries in the queue.

R- 5. The bft  command invoked with  no arguments will  display a
      listing of requests in the queue.

R- 6. The  bft cancel  directive will  allow the  user to  remove
      requests from the queue.

R- 7. Added the  -file_type {binary | ascii}  control argument to
      the  bft fetch and  store directives to  allow the user  to
      specify whether or not <CR><NL>  - <NL> conversions will be
      performed.

R- 8. Added  the -queue  control argument  to the  bft fetch  and
      store  directives  to  specify  transfer  priority  of  the
      request (1 - 4 with 1 being the highest priority).

R- 9. Starname  expansion provision will  be accepted by  the bft
      store and fetch directives to allow the user a more dynamic
      means of transfer request specification.

R-10. A  number of  new features   are being  added to  WSTERM to
      increase  its functionality  and usability.   These include
      editing, auditing,  help and command  history capabilities.
      /A - specifies  the name of the audit file  to write to for
      file audit.  /P - specifies the printer card (0 - 3) to use
      for line printing.

      Changes to WSTERM:  1) A new keyboard input routine will be
      added which will allow some EMACS-like editing capabilities
      on  keyboard input before  sending a line  to the host;  2)
      Input going to and coming from  the host will be trapped by
      WSTERM  to allow  the data  to be  stored to  a file and/or
      printed as it is being displayed; 3) Lines of input will be
      saved in  a circular buffer  each time they  are entered to
      allow them  to be retrieved  later; 4) Routines  for saving
      and restoring  screen contents to  and from a  local buffer
      will allow a help screen to be displayed without disturbing
      the  displaying of  terminal/host dialog;  5) Routines  for
      saving  and  restoring  screen  contents  will  also  allow
      background messages to be displayed  on a screen of its own
      without disturbing the  displaying of terminal/host dialog;
      6) In addition to signaling  the presence of background and
      foreground  messages, the  bottom line  of the  screen will
      display the current WSTERM modes  7) The control-S key will
      be  used to  stop the  screen from  scrolling; and,  8) The
      BREAK, ^@ or ^2 key, and the DEL key will be made to send a
      break   signal,   nul   character   and   delete  character
      respectively.

R-11. The Asynchronous/Non-Edit WSTERM terminal emulation mode is
      being  replaced  with  an  Asynchrounous/Edit  mode.   This
      contains  considerable keyboard and  terminal enhancements,
      thus making the Non-Edit mode obsolete.


_E_M_A_C_S_, _V_e_r_s_i_o_n _1_2_._9

S- 1. Extended  the  EMACS  editor  to  support  direct input and
      display of 8-bit characters.  In order to use this feature,
      the  terminal must  be able   to generate  8-bit codes  and
      display graphics corresponding to 8-bit codes received.

S- 2. The modified  EMACS terminal controller  function DCTL-init
      must set the LISP  variable DCTL-extended-ascii to non-nil.
      Also,  the  TTF  entry  for  the  terminal  must  define an
      output_conversion table  that defines the  8-bit characters
      that can  be directly displayed  by the terminal.   See the
      EMACS  Extension  Writer's  Guide,  Order  Number CJ52, for
      details.

S- 3. Modified EMACS to support the following new terminal types:

                VERSATERM_80C_36L         VERSATERM_80C_36L_OFLOW
                VERSATERM_102C_36L        VERSATERM_102C_36L_OFLOW
                VERSATERM220_80C_36L      VERSATERM220_80C_36L_OFLOW
                VERSATERM220_102C_36L     VERSATERM220_102C_36L_OFLOW

      EMACS will use  the current line and page  lengths from the
      tty_  mode  string  to  determine  how  large  a screen the
      Versaterm  Terminal Emulator  on the  Macintosh is actually
      supporting.

T- 1. Added new field labeled "Reply-To:" for the header built by
      the xmail  send and reply editors.  By  editing this field,
      users  may  now  designate  a  recipient  of  replies.  The
      default recipient is the sender.

      This  change  introduces  a  minor  incompatability between
      deferred messages created and  referenced with MR12.2 xmail
      and  those deferred in  MR12.2, but referenced  by previous
      versions  of xmail.   In order   to adapt  this feature  to
      deferred messages which were created by pre-MR12.2 versions
      of xmail, the new "Reply-To:"  line will be appended to all
      deferred messages.  Deferred messages created or redeferred
      in MR12.2  and subsequently accessed by  an earlier version
      of xmail  will show the  "Reply-To:" field appended  to the
      end of  the "Subject:" line.  This problem  can be overcome
      by editing the subject to remove the extraneous data.

U- 1. Modified Fortran to extend  the maximum length of character
      variables  from  512  up  to  12BK-1  (131071)  characters.
      Character limits in static  and automatic storage may cause
      fatal  compiler errors.   These  errors  can be  avoided by
      using the -large_array, -la, option.

V- 1. Enhanced  the  IMFT  facility  to  support  the  use of the
      -delete, -no_delete, -extend, -replace, and -update control
      arguments with the enter_imft_request, eir, command.

      IMFT  drivers  may  now   be  configured  to  operate  over
      asynchronous channels including X.25 public networks.  This
      support includes  automatic disconnecting when  the drivers
      are idle to reduce X.25 connection charges.

      Access checking  has been extended to require  that the ACL
      for each  object transmitted will be checked  and must have
      explicit "r" or "s" access for both the user and the daemon
      on  the system that  is sending the  data.  The use  of the
      -delete  control argument requires  that both the  user and
      daemon have  explicit "sma" access on  the parent directory
      of the object  specified in the eir command  line.  See the
      Inter-Multics  File  Transfer  Facility  Reference  Manual,
      Order Number CY73, for more information.


_M_R_D_S

W- 1. Added a mrds search list named "mrds" with a default search
      path   of  -working_dir.     The  following   commands  and
      subroutines  use the  mrds search  list to  search for mrds
      databases.          adjust_mrds_db,         copy_mrds_data,
      create_mrds_dm_include,create_mrds_dm_table,
      display_mrds_db_access,         display_mrds_db_population,
      display_mrds_db_status,            display_mrds_db_version,
      display_mrds_dm,        display_mrds_dsm,        mrds_call,
      quiesce_mrds_db,     secure_mrds_db,    unpopulate_mrds_db,
      restructure_mrds_db (ready request),  linus (open request),
      dsl_$open,     dsl_$get_path_info,     msmi_$open_submodel,
      mmi_$get_secured_state,             mmi_$get_authorization,
      mmi_$open_model, mmi_$quiesce_db and mmi_$unquiesce_db.

W- 2. Modified  MRDS  to  report  syntax  and  semantic errors in
      selection expressions via  a new condition, mrds_se_error_.
      The  default   handler  for  this  condition   formats  the
      selection expression that caused  the error and displays it
      on  the  error_output  switch  along  with other diagnostic
      information.  This  behaviour may be controlled  by the new
      set_mrds_options command described below.

W- 3. Modified  MRDS to no  longer enforce the  rigid parentheses
      rules of the past.  Parentheses  are still allowed, but are
      only needed to establish operator precedence.

W- 4. Added  a  new  command,  set_mrds_options.   This provision
      gives users a  finer control over the way  MRDS operates in
      their process.

      attachment  of laser  printers as  remote devices.  Initial
      implememtation is for the  Honeywell Bull Model 80 printer.
      Among the  enhancements are print orientation  on the page,
      font  selection, site-defined  head and  tail sheets,  etc.
      Defaults have  been chosen for  the new features  such that
      the  current I/O  daemon tables   source file  may be  used
      as-is.   The  addition  of  the  new  features  has  caused
      incompatible  changes in  the compiled  I/O daemon  tables.
      The sites  current tables must be recompiled  using the new

B- 1. Changed the  TTF to include special  character sequences of
      up to  15 characters instead  of the current  limitation of
      three.  The current system TTF  must be converted using the
      change  cv_ttf  command  and  the  resulting  TTT  must  be
      installed.  All  user-written TTFs must also  be recompiled
      before use.  The set_ttt_path  command will report an error
      advising  user to  recompile the  TTF if  their version  is
      incorrect.   Although  the  size  of  the special charaters
      structure  has  changed,  users  of  the  "set_special" and
      "get_special" control  orders should not be  affected since
      the code is upward compatible.  However, any other users of
      the c_chars structure may be affected since the size of the
      character array has been changed.

B- 2. The print_terminal_type command now takes a starname option
      of  the specific  terminal type  nmaes to  print.  This has
      caused  an  incompatible  syntax  change.   The displat_ttt
      command now allowa starnames  for either the -terminal_type

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
