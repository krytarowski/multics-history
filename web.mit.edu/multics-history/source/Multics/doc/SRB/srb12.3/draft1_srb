A- 1. [MCR 7811]..  The BCE restore request has  been modified to
      zero clear the unused area at the end of the VTOC region on
      the  physical  volume  being  restored,  before the restore
      begins.   This  is  to  avoid  the  possibility  of  having
      non-zero data in this area  that would later be interpreted
      as an invalid VTOCE.

A- 2. [MCR 7796].. An option now exists for pre-defining the data
      needed to  locate the Root Physical Volume  (RPV) st system
      boot time.  This data can  be placed in the hardcore.header
      segment and subsequently placed  on the Multics System Tape
      (MST)  by generate_mst.   See  the  description of  the new
      "default_rpv_data"  minor keyword in  generate_mst.onfo for
      more details.

A- 3. [MCR 7870].. The console beeper will no longer be turned on
      when  rcp_init is unable  to read the  options from a  tape
      handler during system initialization.

B- 1. [MCR 7880]..
       new  initializer  (Operator)  request, list_vol_attachment
      (lvat), is now  available which will display a  list of the
      current attachment(s)  to a LV, set  of LVs or all  the LVs
      that have attachments.

D- 1. [MCR 7969].. When the new_user command is used to time_lock
      the  password of  a user,   that user  will be  immediately
      bumbed from  the system if  logged in unless  they have the
      "nobump" user attribute.

D- 2. [MCR  7760].. The  reset_soos command  may now  be used  to
      reset  the security_out_of_service   switch on  segments as
      well as directories.

F- 1. [MCR  7827]..   A  new  control  arguement,   -no_trim,  is
      available for use with  the query/responce command/af.  The
      -no_trim  arguement  will  cause  query/responce  questions
      which contain trailing spaces to not be trimmed.

F- 2. [MCR  7817]..  Change  dunp_segment  and  ring_zero_dump to
      display data as PL/1 structures  similar to the probe value
      request.

F- 3. [MCR  7788]..  The  control  arguements  -inhibit_error and
      -no_inhibit_error have been added to the where_search_paths
      active function.  -ihe causes a  null string to be returned
      instead  of returning  an error  when no  matching entry is
      found.







Contents of MR12.2             3-3                        SRB12.1


F- 4. [MCR  7797]..  The  add_search_rules  and  add_search_paths
      commands   now  accept    the  -inhibit_error   (-ihe)  and
      -no_inhibit_error   (-nihe)   control   arguements,   which
      determine   whether  to    print  warning   messages  about
      nonexistent  pathnames  and  paths  already  in  the search
      rules/search  list.   The   add_search_paths  commands  now
      accepts the  -force (-fc) control argument  to allow adding
      paths already  in the search  list to new  positions in the
      list.   -no_force (-nfc)  has been  added to  override this
      control  argument.   The  delete_search_paths  command  now
      recognizes the  short forms of the  pathname keywords (viz:
      -wd, -pd, -rd, -hd).

F- 5. [MCR 7686].. Users may  now request line-numbered printouts
      from  the  I/O  SysDaemons  by  the  new  control  argument
      -number,   -nb   to   the   enter_output_request   command.
      Line-numbers will appear on the  output as they do from the
      print  command.   See  the   online  help  files  for  more
      information.

F- 6. [MCR  7804].. The  print_terminal_type command  now takes a
      starname  option of  the  specific  terminal type  nmaes to
      print.  This has caused an incompatible syntax change.  The
      displat_ttt  command now  allowa starnames  for either  the
      -terminal_type  or -table options.   It also allows  a like
      definition to be completely expanded.

F- 7. [MCR 7822]..  The search rules  commands (add_search_rules,
      set_search_rules,  delete_search_rules, print_search_rules)
      are   now   obsolete,   though   they   will   be  retained
      indefinitely.    In  their   place,  the   search  facility
      (add_search_paths,  set_search_paths,  delete_search_paths,
      print_search_paths) now manipulate  the search rules (using
      the  "linker" search list).   The search facility  also now
      keeps track  of pathname by UID, so  multiole refercnces to
      an entry in a search list need not be by the same name.

F- 8. [MCR 7753]..  The -interpret (-int, -it)  and -no_interpret
      (-nint,  -nit)   arguments  have  been  removed   from  the
      disk_queue command.

F- 9. [MCR     7836]..    The    virtual_entry     argument    to
      display_entry_point_dcl, and the virtual_entry data item in
      the  pl1.dcl declair  file may   now be  given in  the form
      "entry" or  "entry$entry", as in "ask_"  or "ask_$ask_" for
      an equal match.  See the online help file.

F-10. [MCR 7868].. The basic  compiler can now associate severity
      levels with error messages.   The severity command will now
      work with basic.

F-11. [MCR 7832].. A new control  argument, -data, has been added
      to   the   value_get   command   which   will   return  the
      uninterpreted  contents of  data-type values  from a  value
      segment.  Which can then be routed into a temporary segment
      for  display with  the dump_segment  command or  some other
      use.  See the online help file for details.

F-12. [MCR 7874].. The  new command "set_lisp_temp_dir" specifies
      a  directory for temporary  segments created during  a lisp
      environment such  as emacs or lisp_compiler.   Any new lisp
      temp  segs  will  be  placed  in  the  specified directory.
      Existing temp segs will not  be moved to the new directory.
      Temporary segs placed in a directory other than the process
      dir   will  be   preserved  across   processes  and  system
      interruptions.  While this is  useful for debugging and for
      holding  large temp  segs, care  should be  taken to delete
      obsolete  segs  as  each  process  will  create new copies.
      Using a  nonvolatile directory for lisp temp  segs does not
      mean  that the  lisp environment  is restartable  in a  new
      process.

F-13. [MCR 7867].. Changed display_disk_label and display_pvte to
      display disk  partition first records and  sizes in decimal
      and octal.

F-14. [MCR 7867].. Changed list_vols argument processing to allow
      the  -rec_used/-rec_left  and  the  -pv/-lv  arguements  to
      override one another.

F-15. [MCR  7881]..  Accesses  may  now  be  audited for specific
      entries  by  turning  on  the  entrie's  audit switch using
      switch_on command.   This operation requires access  to the
      system_privilege_gate.

F-16. [MCR 7937].. Added the  -state_date control argument to the
      manage_volume_pool set operation.

F-17. [MCR  7849]..  Added  the  -auth,  -home_dir, -no_start_up,
      -process_overseer,  and  -ring  control  arguments  to  the
      enter_abs_request               command.                The
      enter_abs_request_subroutine will use exec_com search paths
      in locating the absin file.

F-18. [MCR 7861]..  Use of the "copy_liveproc"  command will dump
      the contents of an active process directory.

F-19. [MCR  8741]..  A  new  version  (1.2)  of  kermit  has been
      installed.  Kermit  will transmit and  receive nultisegment
      files, and support extended packet length.  See the updated
      info segments for more details.

F-20. [MCR  7913].. A  new command/active_function  "request_info
      (rqi)   is  now   available  toproduce   specific  detailed
      information  about  any  request  queued  in  the absentee,
      output, retrieval, imft or any of the specific request type
      message queues.   Added the -forms control  argument to the
      list_abs_requests (lar) command.


_D_a_t_e_/_T_i_m_e _S_o_f_t_w_a_r_e

G- 1. [MCR  7815]..  Modified  the   date/time  argument  to  the
      date_deleter command  may now contain a  leading hyphen, to
      express a time as -12hours.

G- 2. [MCR  7795].. An option  exists for pre-defining  a default
      time zone,  for use early  in the system  bootload process.
      This  default data  can  be  placed in  the hardcore.header
      segment and subsequently placed  on the Multics System Tape
      (MST)  by generate_mst.   See  the  description of  the new
      "default_time_zone" minor keyword  in generate_mst.info for
      more details.

G- 3. [MCR  7913].. A  new command/active_function  "request_info
      (rqi)  is  now  available   to  produce  specific  detailed
      information  about  any  request  queued  in  the absentee,
      output,  retrieval, imft or  any of the  specific requested
      type message queues.  Added  the -forms control argument to
      the list_abs_requests (lar) command.

G- 4. [MCR 7778].. The abbrev .use  request has been corrected to
      no longer  expand beginning_of_line abbrevs that  match the
      pathname string.

H- 1. [MCR 7842].. In MR12.2 the extended mail system (read_mail,
      print_mail  and send_mail) and  emace rmail use  the search
      list  named  "mlsys"  to  locate  mailboxes  saveboxes  and
      mailing lists.  The default search paths for mlsys are -wd,
      -hd    and    >udd>[person    proj]>[person   name]>[person
      name].mlsys.  Only free standing mailing lists that are not
      archive  components will be  located using the  search path
      facility.

K- 1. [MCR 1024]..  PL/1 will now fecognise  that internal static
      options (constant) variables have constant values, and will
      allow   these  variables   in  many   new  cointexts  where
      previously only literal constants were allowed.

K- 2. [MCR 7724]..  PL/1 will now recognize  that internal static
      options (constant) variables have constant values, and will
      allow these variables in many new contexts where previously
      only literal constants were allowed.


_S_u_b_r_o_u_t_i_n_e_s

L- 1. [MCR 7770]..  Changed hcs_$reset_ips_mask to reset  the IPS
      mask   only    to   values   returned   as    old_mask   by
      hcs_$set_ips_mask.  Such mask values contain a control flag
      in the mask.  This avoids leaving IPS signals masked if the
      user quits  after a cleanup handler is  established to call
      hcs_$reset_ips_mask   but   before   hcs_$set_ips_mask  was
      called.

L- 2. [MCR 7845].. Changed programs  that reference the disk_stat
      segment to allow that segment to become a multisegment file
      if statistics  are recorded for more  directories than will
      fit in a segment.

P- 1. [MCR 7844]..  New control arguments have been  added to the
      LINUS     store,    store_from_data_file,     write,    and
      write_data_file requests to control the printing of warning
      messages  and progress messages.   The -warning/-no_warning
      and -trace/-no_trace arguments control these messages.


_M_O_W_S_E

Q- 1. [MCR   7853]..  The   PC   MOWSE   command  will   cause  a
      communications  connection to  be disconnected  by default,
      unlike  the previous  version  which  provided no  means by
      which   a  connection   could  be   broken.   The   default
      disconnection  can  be  avoided  by  providing  a  new "/H"
      control argument to the PC MOWSE command.

Q- 2. [MCR  7936].. MOWSE  now  correctly  supports the  mark and
      space parity options for the /P control argument.

Q- 3. [MCR 7787].. btf will maintain a queue of transfer requests
      with  priority  levels  (1  -  4)  and  service  the  queue
      automatically.   This will allow  the user to  specify more
      than 2  requests at a  time.  (as was  the restriction with
      the previous implementation).

Q- 4. [MCR   7787]..  The  "recover_store"   and  "recover_fetch"
      directives  will  be  condensed  into  a  single  "recover"
      directive  requiring  no  other  arguments.   bft will then
      automatically  recover interrupted  transfers and  continue
      with the requested entries in the queue.

Q- 5. [MCR  7787]..  The  command  "bft"  with  no arguments will
      display a listing of requests in the queue.

Q- 6. [MCR 7787].. The "cancel" directive  will allow the user to
      remove requests from the queue.

Q- 7. [MCR  7787]..  The  "_file_type  {binary  | ascii}" control
      argument to  the "fetch" and "store"  directives will allow
      the  user  to  specify  whether  or  not  <CR><NL>  -  <NL>
      conversions will be performed.

Q- 8. [MCR 7787].. The "_queue N" control argument to the "fetch"
      and  "store" directives will  be added to  specify transfer
      priority  of the request  (1 - 4  with 1 being  the highest
      priority).

Q- 9. [MCR  7787].. Starname  expansion will  be accepted  by the
      "store"  and "fetch"  directives to  allow the  user a more
      dynamic means of transfer request specification.








Q-10. [MCR..


_E_M_A_C_S

R- 1. [MCR 7851].. The EMACS editor  has been extended to support
      direct input and display of  8-bit characters.  In order to
      use  this feature,  the terminal  must be  able to generate
      8-bit  codes and  display graphics  corresponding to  8-bit
      codes received.

R- 2. [MCR  7851]..   The  EMACS  terminal   controller  function
      DCTL-init must set the LISP variable DCTL-extended-ascii to
      non-nil.  Also, the TTF entry  for the terminal must define
      an   output_conversion  table    that  defines   the  8-bit
      characters that can be  directly displayed by the terminal.
      See the EMACS Extension Writer's Guide (CJ52) for details.

V- 1. [MCR 7840].. There  is now a mrds search  list named "mrds"
      with  a   default  search  path  of   "-working_dir".   The
      following  commands  and  subroutines  use  the mrds search
      list:             adjust_mrds_db,           copy_mrds_data,
      create_mrds_dm_include,create_mrds_dm_table,
      display_mrds_db_access,         display_mrds_db_population,
      display_mrds_db_status,            display_mrds_db_version,

      mmi_$get_secured_state,             mmi_$get_authorization,
      mmi_$open_model, mmi_$quiesce_db and mmi_$unquiesce_db.

V- 2. [7903]..  MRDS now  reports syntax  and semantic  errors in
      selection expressions via  a new condition, mrds_se_error_.
      The  default   handler  for  this  condition   formats  the
      selection expression that caused  the error and displays it
      on  the  error_output  switch  along  with other diagnostic
      information.

V- 3. [7903]..  MRDS  no  longer  enforces  the rigid parentheses
      rules of the past.  Parentheses  are still allowed but only
      used for establishing operator precedence.

V- 4. [7903].. A new command,  set_mrds_options, gives the user a
      finer control over the way MRDS operates in their process.

      displat_ttt  command now  allowa starnames  for either  the

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
