..nua l2h   Commands
..number [MCR 8100]
Modified the system command to use the process date_time format rather than the
concatenation of the process date and time format for all keywords starting
with date_time_**.
..number [MCR 8044]
 Added the capability to specify starnames as input to the dsmla command.  The dsmla command will now display aliases associated with the specified name as well as the specified name itself.
..number [MCR 8022]
Modified the listing of memos created with a -repeat_when_processed control_argument. The change (in the  flags description) is from per_process to repeat_when_processed.
..number [MCR 8020]
When copying a non-empty mailbox along its max_length characterisic, the copy would prematurely terminate with an error of "The requested action was not performed".  This is being changed to allow the copy to continue.  The consequences are that under this condition, the max_lenght of the target of the copy will keep the default max_lenght from when it was created, as opposed to the expected value from the source.
The following commands and subroutines will be affected -copy, move, copy_dir,move_dir, copy_, copy_seg_ and copy_dir_.
..number [MCR 8128]
Added the gate entry mail_table_priv_$delete_alias_case_ins to permit case-insensitive alias deletions by the update_mail_table_entry command.
..number [MCR 8135]
1.  Modified the display format for display_volume_log to print at 79
characters per line.  Also the ability to display the disk label  of the
volume presented in the volog is added through the -label, -no_label and -all
control arguments.
.spb
2.  Modified display format of display_pvolog to print in columnized output of
79 characters per line.
.spb
3.  Changed the set_volume_log command to allow the setting of the number of
consolidated and inceremental reload groups through the -incr_sets and
-cons_sets control arguments.
.spb
4.  Enhanced the purging mechanism to provide better control over reload
groups.
.spb
5.  Removed the -incr_skip_count argument for the volume dumper commands. The
nw -purge_volume_log (-pvl) control argument is now used instead.  Please use
the set_volume_log command to establish the correct reload groups for your site.  Please type: "help set_volume_log" for details.
.inl 0
..nua l1h Languages
..nua l2h   C Language
..number [MCR 8026]
Modified the C_compile command's control argument -table (-tb) so it will no longer cause the generation of a linkage editor listing, use the -list (-ls) control argument instead.  The C_compile command now finds the default C funtime library using standard search rules.
..number [MCR 8080]
Modified the C runtime system and the execution family of routines to properly set their return values.  This value contains information about nonstandard operation of the child process.
..nua l2h    PL/1
..number [MCR 8069]
Added the -version (default) and -no_default control arguments to the PL/1 Compiler.
..number [MCR 8121]
Modified the PL/1 Compiler to generate warnings when an options (constant) variable occurs on the LHS of an assignment statement.
..number [MCR 8023]
Added the control order get_event_channel to mowse_io_ so that programs which require the use of a foreground data event channel, such as dial_out, may request the identification of the ipc_event channel.
..number [MCR8139]
Modified the PL/1 Compiler to allow use of the named constants as replication factors.
.spf
Changes to WSTERM:
.spf
.inl +3
.unl 3
1. A new keyboard input routine will be added which will
allow some EMACS-like editing capabilities on keyboard input before sending a
line to the host.
.spf
.unl 3
2. Input going to and coming from the host will be trapped
by WSTERM to allow the data to be stored to a file and/or printed as it is
being displayed.
.spf
.unl 3
3. Lines of input will be saved in a circular buffer each
time they are entered to allow them to be retrieved later.
..nua l2h   EMACS, Version 12.9
..number [MCR 8076]
    f (rmail-forward) to forward the current message to an address (list) that will be prompted for.  A numeric argument will allow the user to enter redistribution comments via a comments buffer.

2.  x (rmail-toggle-seen) to toggle the seen switch on the current message. This switch is displayed to the user as the minor mode "Seen" and will be turned on immediately a message is brought into the RMAIL buffer to be displayed.

3.  ?  (rmail-help) to display brief information about each of the RMAIL mode (additionally the reply and comment buffers) requests that are available.

4.  q (rmail-quit) is being modified to only question a user quitting when no rmail commands have been entered between the arrival of new mail and requesting of rmail-quit.
..number [MCR 8088]
Modified emacs -line_length NN control argument so that NN will be expected to
describe the useable number of columns on the screen.  The value of NN used to
be required to be one grater than the screen capability.
..nua l2h   EDITORS
..number [MCR 8057]

Modified qedx to allow whitespaces between the "q" request and the NL character.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
