A- 1. This  version of  the  assembler  contains a  new pseudo-op
      "error",  several  bug  fixes,  and  discontinuation of the
      obsolete "followon" pseudo-op.  It's use will now incur a B
      error.  The  "error" pseudo-op causes the  fatal error flag
      to  be  set  which  results  in  the  "Translation failed."
      message being  issued at the  end of the  assembly.  "-nsb"
      will now be accepted  as an abbreviation for "-no_symbols".
      The  assembler will now  prevent itself from  being invoked
      recursively.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
