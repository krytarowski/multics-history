The firmware identification for MR12.1 is "IFAD C.3".
.spb 2
IFAD (Integrated Firmware and Diagnostics) tapes, are distributed to all sites
having valid Field Engineering Hardware Maintenance contracts.  The IFAD C.3
tape is distributed as FCO PHAFGA726.
.spb 2
T&D (Test and Diagnostic) tapes, are distributed  to all sites having valid
Field Engineering Hardware Maintenance contracts.  The T&D tape is distributed
as FCO PHAFGA888, rev. B.2.
.spb 2
This version of IFAD, firmware, and T&D modules has been tested and exposed on
System M in Phoenix.  The modules are supplied as part of the MR12.1 release
and can be found in >ldd>firmware as part of the LDD_STANDARD tape.  When
subsequent IFAD tapes become available, it is recommended that the site use
the deckfile_manager, dfm, command to load the released IFAD tape into
>system_library_tandd.  The firmware modules should then be moved to
>ldd>firmware and a new MST tape should be generated using generate_mst.

The MR12.1 release requires the following firmware revision levels.

.ifi l1h "Field Change Order List"
The following list of FCOs should be thought of as a continuation of the
similar list for MR12.0.  Sites that are upgrading from MR12.0 will need to
verify that  FCOs for that release have been installed.
.spb
As FCOs are completed in Phoenix, they are sent out to the field sites.
Some of the FCOs affect only site documentation while others may change the
hardware to improve system reliability or maintainability.  An example might
be a change to improve the supply of cooling air to some boards so that the
boards run cooler and are therefore less likely to fail.  These types of FCOs
are important to the long-term success of system operation.
However, because these FCOs are not required to correct the results of any
computer program, they are not listed in this SRB.
.spb
The purpose of this section is to identify those FCOs that are of utmost
importance in the short term.  This list includes only those FCOs needed to
correct a program malfunction.
.spb
For those FCOs already sent to the field, the "FCO Kit Ship Date" column
contains the approximate date when shipment of the FCO kits began.  
.spb 2
One of the column headings in the tables on the following pages is "Round
Robin".  The implications of a "Yes" in this column for a particular FCO are
as follows:
.spb
.inl +5
.unl 5
1.   The FCO kit includes at least one board.
The new board(s) is
to replace the board(s) now in the equipment.
.spb
.unl 5
2.   Enough FCO kits are put together for about 20% of the sites
that are to take part in the Round Robin.
Some FCOs result in a Round Robin for all sites.
Other FCOs involve a Round Robin for some sites but not for other sites.
For example, two of the factors that determine whether or not
a  particular site takes part in a Round Robin  FCO are:
.spb
.inl 10
.unl 5
a.   The date codes of certain integrated circuit chips on a board.
.spb
.unl 5
b.   The board construction method -- wirewrap vs. multilayer.
.spb
.inl 5
.unl 5
3.   The set of FCO kits are sent to the first set of sites.
(For the remainder of this discussion,
we will follow one kit as it makes its Round Robin journey.)
.spb
.unl 5
4.   The site installs the FCO.
When the site is satisfied that the FCO is satisfactory, the site
returns the old board(s) to Phoenix.
.spb
.unl 5
5.   If there is still equipment at other sites
that have not had the FCO installed,
the returned board(s) is reworked, tested, and
another FCO kit is  assembled in Phoenix
and sent to the next site.
.spb
.unl 5
6.   Since the length of time it takes a site to
install an FCO and become satisfied that it is
working correctly cannot be known in advance, there
is no way to predict with accuracy how long it
will be until the FCO has been installed at all
sites.
.inl -5
.spb 2
The FCOs have been classified into the following categories:
.spb 2
.inl +13
.unl 13
C_A_T_E_G_O_R_Y__1_ - The new software for this release
will not run properly unless these FCOs are installed.
.spb 2
.unl 13
C_A_T_E_G_O_R_Y__2_ - The new software for this release may or may not
run properly if these FCOs are not installed.  It is strongly recomended
to have these FCOs installed to improve reliability of the system.
.spb 2
.unl 13
C_A_T_E_G_O_R_Y__3_ - FCOs whose effects are program-visible, but do not fall
into categories 1 or 2.  Category 3 FCOs correct problems that are not
uniquely related to this release.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
