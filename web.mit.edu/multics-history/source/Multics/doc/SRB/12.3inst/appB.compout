                         FORMATTING DISKS WITH MTR




     This  appendix describes  a procedure  for formatting  disk packs
     using the Media Test Routines  (MTRs).  The procedure utilizes an
     annotated script  which shows typical input  and output.  Because
     the  formatting procedures  differ for  MSU0451 and  MSU0500/0501
     devices,  separate scripts are  provided.  In the  scripts, input
     typed by the user is preceded by a ox (bullet).


     _F_O_R_M_A_T_T_I_N_G _M_S_U_0_4_5_1 _D_I_S_K _P_A_C_K_S

     The following script shows how to run MTR tests 6 and 3 to format
     and test an MSU0451 disk pack, and to assign alternates to tracks
     found defective during testing.

      1.  Enter the Total OnLine Test System (TOLTS):

     ox bound_tolts_$tolts_

       *olts executive version 810301 on 820812 at 20.071

      2.  Enter the MPC OnLine Test Subsystem (MOLTS):

       *enter "polts", "molts", "colts", "isolts", "quit", or "msg"
       ???  ox molts

      3.  List  the  disk  configuration  for  the  disk  string which
          formatting will be done
           (because of page constraints,  the following message is not
          an exact copy of that which is displayed by the system):

       ???  ox test pcd

       peripheral configuration:

       dska 451 16 units; starting with device no. 1
        020xx   primary channel of 4 logical channels on mpc mspa
        026xx   secondary channel of 4 logical channels on mpc mspa
        124xx   secondary channel of 4 logical channels on mpc mspb
        122xx   secondary channel of 4 logical channels on mpc mspb



      4.  Enter MTR test 6 to format and test the MSU0451 device:

       ??? ox test mmt12020t6

          where  "test mmt12020t6"  is a  sample of  the input  format
          "test mmtICCDDtT":

             mmt  identifies the MTR test package

             ICC  gives the IOM number (0 = IOM A, 1 = IOM B, etc) and
                  channel  number (in decimal)  of a channel  by which
                  the  device to  be formatted  can be  addressed.  It
                  must be  one of those  shown in the  output of "test
                  pcd" in step 3.  In the sample input above, "120" is
                  IOM B, channel 20.

             DD   gives the  device number (in decimal)  of the device
                  to be tested.  In the  sample input, it is device 20
                  (dskb_20).

             T    gives the number of the MTR test to be run.  In this
                  case, test 6 should be run to format/test a pack.

      5.  The following output describes steps  taken by MTR test 6 to
          attach the disk drive and mount the pack for writing:

       *0(mmt12020)
       ** begin format pack ***
       the test will format all tracks on the pack.  format will

       (no alt.  assigned).
       *0(mmt12020)
       system device code = .ds450

      6.  Answer MTR  initialization questions (not a  restart, normal
          formatting, and use 3 write patterns during testing):

       *0(mmt12020)
       is this a restart?  enter (y or n) - ox n
       *0(mmt12020)
       select (f)ast or (n)ormal format?  (f)ast format is designed
       for data security erase and/or test purposes.  (n)ormal format
       is designed for disk packs that are going to be used in systems
       applications.  enter (f or n) - ox n
       *0(mmt12020)
       select from "1" to "7" write patterns?  enter (1 thru 7) - ox 3

      7.  At this point, formatting of the pack begins:

       *0(mmt12020)
       ** begin disk pack format ***

      8.  After the  message in Step  7 is displayed,  press the BREAK
          key to interrupt formatting  operations.  When MOLTS prompts
          for  input,  set  test   options  to:   report  the  current
          cylinder/head (CCC/HH) address; display CCC/HH for transient
          errors;  report  test  progress  every  100  cylinders, with
          summary reports attached.

       ox <PRESS BREAK KEY>
       ???  ox test momt12020.r

           where "test momt12020.r" is a sample of the input format
           "test momtICCDD.O":

             momt    identifies request to set options

             ICCDD   are the IOM, Channel  and Device numbers given in
                     Step 4.

             .r      is  the first  option, to  report current  CCC/HH
                     location.

          Set the remaining options when prompted:

       *0(mmt12020) t6 enter options:  ox .i
       *0(mmt12020) t6 enter options:  ox .e
       *0(mmt12020) t6 enter options:  ox .s
       *0(mmt12020) t6 enter options:  ox .t
       *0(mmt12020) t6 enter options:  ox .go

      9.  When the  .go option is entered  in Step 8, MTR  reports the
          current location being formatted  and displays the defective
          tracks  found.   It  then  asks  if  you  want  to  continue
          formatting:

       *0(mmt12020)
       format function current addr. = 007/00
       *0(mmt12020)
       format function current addr. = 007/00
       *0(mmt12020)
       ** rmc6 - summary report ***
       no tracks were formatted defective
       *0(mmt12020)
       do you want the test to continue?  enter (y or n) - ox y

     10.  After  every  100  cylinders  are  formatted,  MTR  displays
          defective  tracks  found.   For  example,  the final summary
          displayed just before formatting completes, looks like:

       *0(mmt12020)
       rmc6 has formatted tracks "000/00 thru 700/00"
       *0(mmt12020)
       ** rmc6 - summary report ***
       no tracks were formatted defective
       *0(mmt12020)
       rmc6 has formatted tracks "000/00 thru 800/00"
       *0(mmt12020)
       ** rmc6 - summary report ***
       no tracks were formatted defective
       *0(mmt12020)
       ** disk pack format complete ***

     11.  After formatting is complete,  MTR begins testing the tracks
          on  the  formatted  pack.    Defective  tracks  are  usually
          encountered only during the  testing phase.  Error summaries
          are displayed after every 100 cylinders have been tested.

     12.  When  testing is  complete, termination  summary reports are
          displayed:

       *0(mmt12020)
       ** normal termination summary reports ***
       *0(mmt12020)

     13.  MTR then asks  if you want to select a  new test (answer "y"
          for yes):

       *0(mmt12020)
       want to select a new test?
       enter (y or n) - ox y

     14.  MTR then  displays information describing how  to select the
          next test:

     15.  To actually  select the next  test, press the  BREAK key and
          wait  for  the  MOLTS  prompt.   Then  select  test 3, which
          assigns  alternate  tracks  for  those  tracks  found  to be
          defective above.

       ox <PRESS BREAK KEY>
       ???  ox test momt12020t3

          where "test momt12020t3" is a sample of the input format
          "test momtICCDDtT":

             ICCDD   are the IOM, Channel  and Device numbers given in
                     Step 4.

             tT      gives the number of the next test to run.

          Test 3 initialization displays the following information:

     17.  MTR then briefly describes the subtest, and asks if you want
          to continue (answer "y" for yes)

       *0(mmt12020)
       ** begin subtst 4 ***
       assign alternate tracks on the device
       a) subtst will search thru all standard tracks looking for
          tracks marked defective (no alternate assigned).
       b) when a track marked defective (no alternate assigned) is
          detected, the subtst will stop and process this track.
       c) the alternate track processor will go out to the alternate
          track cylinders and find the first available alternate.  it
          will mark the track as assigned alternate.  then it will
          mark the standard track as defective (alt.  assigned).
       d) the search process will terminate after the last standard
          track completes testing and/or processing.
       do you want the subtst to continue?  enter (y or n) - ox y

     18.  MTR then  asks for permission to overwrite  the pack's label
          (answer "y" for yes):

       *0(mmt12020)
       ** rmc3 - label obliterate warning ***
       all sub tests in rmc3 will overwrite the system
       label on track zero.
       do you want the sub test to continue?  enter (y or n) - ox y

     19.  MTR then asks if you are restarting (answer "n" for no):

       *0(mmt12020)
       system device code = .ds450
       *0(mmt12020)
       is this a restart?  enter (y or n) -  ox n

     20.  MTR then  begins displaying summary reports  after every 100
          cylinders are checked for alternate assignments:

       *0(mmt12020)

     The following script shows how to run MTR tests 6 and 7 to format
     and  test  an  MSU0500  or  MSU0501  disk  drive,  and  to assign
     alternates to tracks found defective during testing.

     The MPC normally  treats an MSU0500 or MSU0501 disk  drive as two
     separately addressable  devices.  However, MTR formats  and tests
     both logical devices during a single invocation, referring to one
     as the "odd  device" (e.g., dskc_27) and the second  as the "even
     device" (e.g., dskc_28).  MTR refers to both logical devices as a
     single "head assembly" or "hda".

      1.  Enter the Total OnLine Test System (TOLTS):

                     input above, "128" is IOM B, channel 28.

             DD      gives  the  device  number  (in  decimal)  of the
                     device to be tested.  In  the sample input, it is
                     device  27  (dskc_27).   Always  give  the device
                     number  of the  "odd device"  associated with the
                     disk drive.

             T       gives the number  of the MTR test to  be run.  In

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
