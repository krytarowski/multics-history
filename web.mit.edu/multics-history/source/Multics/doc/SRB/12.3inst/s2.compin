The primary pathnames on most of the system directories are somewhat
lengthy.  For this document, abbreviated (added) names are
used in lieu of the primary name.  The following list gives the
primary and abbreviated names used in this document.

The system directories firmware and obs, are not included in the standard
system search rules.  Segments in these directories must either be accessed by
absolute pathnames or by changing the system search rules via the
set_system_search_rules command added to the system_start_up.ec.

.ifi l1h "Contents of MR12.3 Package"
MR12.3 includes this document, a set of magnetic tapes, hardcopy dump maps, and
accompanying documentation.  Sites not installing Multics for the first time
will be able to proceed to the MR12.3 release from MR12.2.
Sites upgrading to MR12.3 from MR12.2
 refer to Section 4, sites installing
Multics for the first time refer to Section 5.  The instructions in each
section will provide a procedure to guide a site through the installation.
.spb
Documentation for some of the new features and TRs resolved in this release is
contained in the directory >doc>MR12.3 which is part of this release.
.spb
This is a total software release.  It contains a complete set of all modules
contained in the Multics standard system.
.spb
Appendix A will list modules added, modified or deleted since MR12.2.
.spb
Appendix B contains an outline of the use of MTR under Multics.
.spb
A set of master tapes was generated for this release and all dump maps
reflect the contents of these master tapes.  All tapes sent to the field are
copies of the master tapes.  Because of different lengths of magnetic tape
reels, there may not be an exact correlation between a single tape and a dump
map.
.spb
These differences, if any, are minimal and occur only on those sets that are
multi-reel (e.g., 12.3LDD_STANDARD tapes).  Site personnel may assure themselves
of the contents of the tapes by visually matching the maps produced from the
reload operations against the master dump maps supplied.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
