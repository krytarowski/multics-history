                                INTRODUCTION




     This   document   describes   the   MR12.2   package.    Detailed
     instructions for installation of a  system for the first time and
     upgrading to  MR12.2 from an  MR12.1 system constitute  the major
     portion of this document.

     No  attempt is  made to  document features  of MR12.2  other than
     those directly required for its installation.

     Software Releases  prior to MR12.1 are no  longer supported.  All
     sites  running  pre-MR12.1  software  are  strongly encouraged to
     upgrade to MR12.1 as soon as possible.

     System  Representatives  who  support  Multics  should  apply for
     registration  on  the  SiteSA  project  maintained  in Phoenix on
     System M.

     The SiteSA project was created to allow sites to communicate with
     Multics  System  Support  (MSS)  personnel  on  matters  of  site
     support.  MSS maintains and pays for usage on this project.  Only
     System Representatives who support  a Multics site are authorized
     to use the project.  They are  authorized to use it only for site
     support activities which require  communication of information to
     MSS personnel.

     MSS would  appreciate that the  SiteSAs maintain the  site's info
     segments in >udd>SiteSA>site_info  (>udd>ssa>si).  Information on
     maintaining   these   segments   is    in   the   info   segment,
     >udd>ssa>si>site_info.info.

     In addition  to normal telephone and  Multics mail communications
     with   MSS  personnel,   SiteSAs  are   encouraged  to   use  the
     unusual_crash_log  forum meeting  to report  any unusual problems
     encountered at  their site.  SiteSAs not familiar  with forum can
     type "help  forum" for usage  information.  Forum is  a subsystem

     somewhat like the mail system  in which an electronic meeting can
     be held.  To invoke forum, type:

        forum >udd>ssa>sa_meeting>uclog

     Type  ?  to  print a  list of  requests allowed  by forum.  Other
     forum meetings of interest to SiteSAs are:

                 PATHNAME                              SHORT NAME

        >udd>ssa>sa_meeting>critical_fixes             fixes

     We would  appreciate that sites as they  complete installation of
     MR12.2 enter a transaction in the install_instructions (ii) forum
     meeting.   This  will  allow  other  sites  to  see the amount of
     exposure the release is receiving and to communicate any problems
     encountered in the installation procedure.

     MSS also suggests, very strongly,  that SiteSAs DO NOT attempt to
     reproduce site problems on System M  which are known to crash the
     system at  their site, cause processors  to loop in ring  0, etc.
     Such problems  should be reported via the  Trouble Report system,
     and  will   be  verified  by  MSS   personnel  using  appropriate
     resources,   so  that  System   M  service  is   not  interrupted
     unnecessarily.

     Problems encountered  while installing this release,  or problems
     of  a critical  nature to  a customer  site (for  a definition of
     critical, type:  help tr.priorities)  should be reported directly
     to  MSS by  mail or   phone.  European  or Canadian  sites should
     contact their  local site support  person for details  on support
     from  the Canadian,  French or  UK Technical  Assistance Centers.
     Phoenix personnel include:

     The  primary pathnames  on most   of the  system directories  are
     somewhat lengthy.   For this document, abbreviated  (added) names
     are used in  lieu of the primary name.  The  following list gives
     the primary and abbreviated names used in this document.

     The system directories firmware and  obs, are not included in the
     standard system search rules.  Segments in these directories must
     either  be accessed  by absolute   pathnames or  by changing  the
     system search rules via the set_system_search_rules command added
     to the system_start_up.ec.

     MR12.2 includes this document, a  set of magnetic tapes, hardcopy
     dump maps, and accompanying  documentation.  Sites not installing
     Multics for the first time will  be able to proceed to the MR12.2
     release from MR12.1.  Sites upgrading to MR12.2 from MR12.1 refer
     to Section 4,  sites installing Multics for the  first time refer
     to Section  5.  The instructions  in each section  will provide a
     procedure to guide a site through the installation.

     Documentation for  some of the  new features and  TRs resolved in
     this release  is contained in the directory  >doc>MR12.2 which is
     part of this release.

     This is a total software release.   It contains a complete set of
     all modules contained in the Multics standard system.

     Appendix  A will  list modules  added, modified  or deleted since
     MR12.1.

     Appendix B contains an outline of the use of MTR under Multics.

     A set of master tapes was generated for this release and all dump
     maps reflect the contents of  these master tapes.  All tapes sent
     to  the  field  are  copies  of  the  master  tapes.   Because of
     different  lengths of magnetic  tape reels, there  may not be  an
     exact correlation between a single tape and a dump map.

     These differences,  if any, are  minimal and occur  only on those
     sets  that are  multi-reel (e.g.,  12.2LDD_STANDARD tapes).  Site
     personnel may assure  themselves of the contents of  the tapes by
     visually  matching the maps  produced from the  reload operations
     against the master dump maps supplied.

                          FCO AND FIRMWARE STATUS




     _F_I_R_M_W_A_R_E

     The firmware identification for MR12.2 is "IFAD D.4".


     IFAD (Integrated Firmware and Diagnostics) tapes, are distributed
     to all sites having  valid Field Engineering Hardware Maintenance
     contracts.  The IFAD tape is  nolonger distributed as an FCO.  It
     is now sent with the MR12.2 release tapes.


     T&D  (Test and  Diagnostic) tapes,  are distributed  to all sites
     having  valid Field  Engineering Hardware  Maintenance contracts.
     The T&D tape is distributed as FCO PHAFGA888, rev.  B.2.


     This version of  IFAD, firmware, and T&D modules  has been tested
     and exposed on System M in  Phoenix.  The modules are supplied as
     part of the  MR12.2 release and can be found  in >ldd>firmware as
     part of the LDD_STANDARD tape.  When subsequent IFAD tapes become
     available,   it   is   recommended   that   the   site   use  the
     deckfile_manager,  dfm, command  to load  the released  IFAD tape
     into >system_library_tandd.  The firmware  modules should then be
     moved  to >ldd>firmware and  a new MST  tape should be  generated
     using generate_mst.


     The  MR12.2  release  requires  the  following  firmware revision
     levels.


                 Disc:  DSC191 -- V1
                        DSC500 -- X1

     The following list of FCOs should be thought of as a continuation
     of the  similar list for  MR12.1.  Sites that  are upgrading from
     MR12.1 will need  to verify that FCOs for that  release have been
     installed.

     As FCOs are completed in Phoenix,  they are sent out to the field
     sites.   Some of  the FCOs  affect only  site documentation while
     others may  change the hardware to improve  system reliability or
     maintainability.   An example  might be  a change  to improve the
     supply  of cooling  air to  some boards  so that  the boards  run
     cooler  and are therefore  less likely to  fail.  These types  of
     FCOs are important to the  long-term success of system operation.
     However,  because these  FCOs are   not required  to correct  the
     results of any computer program, they are not listed in this SRB.

     The purpose of this section is to identify those FCOs that are of
     utmost  importance in  the short  term.  This  list includes only
     those FCOs needed to correct a program malfunction.

     For those FCOs already sent to the field, the "FCO Kit Ship Date"
     column  contains the  approximate date  when shipment  of the FCO
     kits began.


     One of the  column headings in the tables on  the following pages
     is "Round Robin".  The implications of a "Yes" in this column for
     a particular FCO are as follows:

     1.   The FCO kit  includes at least one board.   The new board(s)
          is to replace the board(s) now in the equipment.

     2.   Enough FCO kits are put together  for about 20% of the sites
          that are to take part in  the Round Robin.  Some FCOs result
          in a Round Robin for all  sites.  Other FCOs involve a Round
          Robin for some sites but  not for other sites.  For example,
          two  of  the  factors  that   determine  whether  or  not  a
          particular site takes part in a Round Robin FCO are:

          a.   The date codes of certain integrated circuit chips on a
               board.

          b.   The   board  construction    method  --   wirewrap  vs.
               multilayer.




     Firmware Status                3-2                        SIB12.2


     3.   The  set of  FCO kits  are sent  to the  first set of sites.
          (For the  remainder of this  discussion, we will  follow one
          kit as it makes its Round Robin journey.)

     4.   The site installs the FCO.   When the site is satisfied that
          the FCO  is satisfactory, the site returns  the old board(s)
          to Phoenix.

     5.   If there is still equipment at other sites that have not had
          the  FCO  installed,  the  returned  board(s)  is  reworked,
          tested, and another FCO kit is assembled in Phoenix and sent
          to the next site.

     6.   Since the length  of time it takes a site  to install an FCO
          and become satisfied that it  is working correctly cannot be
          known in advance,  there is no way to  predict with accuracy
          how long it will be until  the FCO has been installed at all
          sites.


     The FCOs have been classified into the following categories:


     _C_A_T_E_G_O_R_Y__1 - The  new  software  for  this  release  will not run
                  properly unless these FCOs are installed.


     _C_A_T_E_G_O_R_Y__2 - The new software for this release may or may not run
                  properly  if these  FCOs are  not installed.   It is
                  strongly recommended to have these FCOs installed to
                  improve reliability of the system.


     _C_A_T_E_G_O_R_Y__3 - FCOs whose  effects are program-visible, but  do not
                  fall  into  categories  1  or  2.   Category  3 FCOs
                  correct  problems that  are not  uniquely related to
                  this release.

           INSTRUCTIONS FOR SITES UPDATING TO MR12.2 FROM MR12.1




     If  problems are encountered  in any of  the Steps listed  below,
     return  to the  last step  known to  be successful  and retry the
     Steps.   Pay  particular  attention  to  procedure.   This entire
     procedure was verified on the  Multics System at Phoenix Computer
     Operations, but some hardware/software differences may exist at a
     particular site.

     In  this section, two  formats of text  are used to  indicate the
     typing of input into the system.  This input usually is a command
     line, but  could be data  typed in response  to a query  from the
     operator console.

     Strings of input, and output messages of importance are indicated
     on separate lines.

     In addition, all input to the system is to be typed in lowercase,
     except  when indicated  by the  occurrence of  both uppercase and
     lowercase  in the  input line.    User input  is preceeded  by an
     exclamation mark (!).

     System display output  is shown as is, except  when the displayed
     line  exceeds the  page margins   for this  document.  When  this
     occurs,  the displayed  line is  split into  two lines,  with the
     second line indented from the first.

     It is recommended  that sites perform a BCE SAVE.   A double save
     is recommended to avoid any possible tape problems later.

     Due to the  method by which unbundled software  is dumped, normal
     trimming  during reloading  of new  software does  not occur.  To
     ensure that unbundled directories are clean execute the following
     before shutting  down MR12.1 for  the last time  enter admin mode
     and type:

          cwd >system_library_unbundled

     Place  the new  MR12.2 Mult  tape on  any convenient  tape drive.
     Initialize and boot the MST.

     The system will boot the  bootload tape controller, if necessary,
     and continue.   At this time you  will be asked to  input the RPV
     location in channel, controller, device and unit number format:

     There  are no  config deck  changes for  MR12.2.  To  examine and
     change the config deck enter the config qedx editor by typing:

          config

     After having made necessary changes exit the editor by typing "w"
     and "q".

     The "w"  request will verify  card syntax.  The  "q" request will
     leave the qedx editor and place the user at the bce(early) level.

     At  this time,  the operator  must load  firmware into  all other
     controllers (i.e., not the bootload  tape controller nor any disk
     controllers).  bce is then considered to be fully initialized.

     At this point the libraries  will be reloaded.  The release tapes
     should   be   reloaded   in   this   specific   sequence:   EXEC,
     LDD_STANDARD, UNB, and MISC.

     To reload the libraries type:



     Instructions - Updating        4-3                        SIB12.2



          reload_system_release -nosetlvid

     When the system asks "Input tape label:" type:  <reel_id>

     where <reel_id> is the reel identification specified for the next
     tape  to  be  reloaded.   See  Section  2,  "Contents  of  MR12.2
     Package," for a listing of all "Tape names".  Enter <reel_id> for
     each library tape.

     When all tapes are loaded, type:

     A  new  standard  TTF  has  been  provided  containing additional
     terminal types.  Sites using a modified site dependent TTF should
     merge these changes with their  modified version, and convert the
     TTF  to its  binary version.   The converted  binary version must
     then be installed to take  effect.  The TTF.ttf segment in >tools
     contains  some of  the more   common used  terminals on  Multics.
     Sites  using the default  TTF for this  release must execute  the
     following commands to perform this conversion:

          cwd >udd>sa>a
          rename TTF.ttf TTF.save
          cp >t>TTF.ttf
          cv_ttf TTF
          install TTF.ttt


     _S_T_E_P _7_:  _F_N_P _C_O_R_E _I_M_A_G_E_S _A_N_D _C_M_F _C_O_N_V_E_R_S_I_O_N

     A Multics  Communications System (CS)  core image is  supplied in
     the >unbundled library, and  is named "site_mcs".  The "site_mcs"
     core image contains  the basic support for DN6780  type FNPs with
     64k of memory.

     CS  core   images  are  built  using  the   bind_fnp  command  in
     conjunction  with  a  bindfile  describing  the  CS  modules  and
     configurations to  be used.  A copy of  the site_mcs.bind_fnp can
     be found in >ldd>mcs>info.

     Sites should build their own CS  core image tailored to their own
     FNP  configuration,  terminal  type   requirements,  and  use  of
     additional separately  priced FNP software modules.   Sites using
     the  default "site_mcs" core  image should skip  to Step 8  after
     ensuring  the CMF image  statement points to  the core image  now
     located in >unb.


     Instructions - Updating        4-4                        SIB12.2



     To build a new core image, the following procedure is suggested:

     Sites  will need  to extract  the communications  object segments
     from archives located in  >ldd>mcs>object.  Sites should create a
     virgin directory under >udd>sa>a for each new core image.

     The  following example  is for  sites with  the more  common type
     Datanet and a larger memory configuration.  Execute the following
     commands:

          create_dir >udd>sa>a>mcs.7.6b
          cwd >udd>sa>a>mcs.7.6b
          qx
          r >ldd>mcs>info>site_mcs.bind_fnp (or location of sites
                                              CS bind file)
          .
          .
          .
          make editing changes if any..
          .
          .
          .
          w site_mcs.bind_fnp
          q
          ac x ([segs >ldd>mcs>o>.archive -absp])
          bind_fnp site_mcs -list

     Be  sure the  image statement  in the  CMF points  to this  newly
     created CS core image.  The name  of the CMF requires a suffix of
     "cmf".   The  following  example  assumes  the  CMF  to be in the
     >udd>sa>a directory.  This procedure will  insure that the new CS
     image is used:

          cwd >udd>sa>a

          qx
     r  CMF.cmf
     .
     .
     1) Edit the image: statement to point to the new CS image.
     2) Make any other changes needed.
     .
     .
     w CMF.cmf
     q

          cv_cmf CMF
          copy CMF.cdt >system_control_1>cdt -force

     The  above procedure builds  a site dependent  CS core image  and
     ensures  that this image  is loaded in  the FNP by  the answering
     service.

     Exit admin mode by typing "ame".  Then issue the commands:

          stop_mpx a        (sites  with  multiple  FNPs  execute this
                            command for each FNP)
          multics

          load_mpx a -check (sites  with  multiple  FNPs  execute this
                            command for each FNP)
          go

     The   load_mpx  command   indicates  on   the  FNP   console  any
     configuration  errors  if  console_man  is  loaded  and "console:
     yes;"  is in  the bind_file.    If any  errors are  reported they
     should be corrected.

     Sites should  assure the correct  version number is  reported the
     first time the FNP is booted.

     The ACLs on these gates are as they appear on System M and should
     be restricted.   The ACL for  these gates are  site dependent and
     should be changed to meet  each site's needs.  The dm_admin_gate_
     and  dm_daemon_gate_  should  be  restricted  to  data management
     administrators or daemons.   The installations_tools_ gate should
     be restricted to system library  maintainers.  All persons on the
     ACL for metering_gate_ have access  to the Multics metering data.
     All  persons on the  ACL for queue_admin_  are permitted to  move
     absentee and  daemon requests for  themselves and other  users to
     different queues.   Users not on this  ACL are only able  to move
     their  own  requests.   The   Initializer  must  have  access  to
     queue_admin_.   This  capability  is  also  dependent on extended
     access to the <queue>.ms  segments.  The various pnt_<name>_gate_
     acls should  be restricted to the following  minimums for correct
     system operation:

                                 SECTION 5


              INSTRUCTIONS FOR SITES INSTALLING FOR FIRST TIME




     The following  basic procedure must be  performed when installing
     Multics for the first time.


     _S_T_E_P _1_:  _P_R_E_P_A_R_A_T_I_O_N


     Ensure that all Multics active hardware components run error free
     in  Multics  mode  using  the  latest  T&D  release.   Peripheral
     equipment can be run in either Multics or GCOS mode and must also
     run error free.

     Carefully  check  the  hardware  configuration  (port and channel
     assignments,  mailbox switch  settings, etc.)   Create and verify
     the configuration  description on paper for later  input when BCE
     is  running.  Close  consultation  between  the SiteSA  and Field
     Engineering representative  is of the utmost  importance.  (Refer
     to Section 9  and Appendix A of the Operator's  Guide to Multics,
     Order  Number  GB61,  for  hardware  switch  setting information.
     Refer to Section 7 of  the Multics System Maintenance Procedures,
     Order Number AM81-03, for configuration setup.)

     When selecting the  storage unit for the RPV, select  a disk unit
     with as few bad tracks as possible.  For the MSS451s, T&Ds should
     be used to format  and test the first disk to be  used as the RPV
     (test 365, subtest 26).

     The MSS500/501s are formatted  at the factory, however, selection
     of alternate tracks  is not done at the factory.   It can only be

     Choose the  logical volume assignments.  Decide  how many logical
     volumes  are needed and  how many physical  volumes are to  be in
     each.

     Most installations have the following:

          Logical Volume Contents

          root                >system_control_1
                              >system_library_standard

          ldd                 >library_dir_dir

     Other logical volumes may be set up for specific applications.

     The  assignment  decision  requires  the  system administrator to
     balance the  costs of seek interference and  breakage against the
     advantages  of  being  able   to  define  and  process  logically
     different collections  of data.  Data  bases used for  only a few
     hours a day or only a few days a month are natural candidates for
     allocation  to  a  separate  logical  volume.   Breaking  up  the
     system's  storage into  several logical  volumes also  allows the
     site to  operate without all logical volumes  mounted if hardware
     goes down.  For example, an MPC or channel might go down, halving
     the system's disk drive capacity.

     These particular assignments give a wide range of flexibility and
     Multics  can run with  only the root  logical volume mounted,  or
     with one or two of the  less critical logical volumes not mounted
     due  to  unavailability  of  disk  drives.   For example, logical
     volumes, list_1 and list_2, can  easily be demounted.  This frees
     two disk drives to be available  for use with other more critical
     logical volumes.

     Installations  that wish  to use  the Access  Isolation Mechanism
     (AIM)  by specifying more  than one access  category (sensitivity
     level) should specify the maximum  and minimum categories for one
     or more volumes  and thus ensure that sensitive  data is confined
     to  a  few  packs,  or  that  packs  are  not "contaminated" with
     information requiring special precautions.

     The logical volumes that hold  process directory segments must be
     chosen.   Because  of  the   heavy  usage  of  process  directory
     segments, these  segments should be spread over  as many physical
     volumes as possible.  One or more logical volumes may be selected
     to  hold process  directory segments,  using the set_pdir_volumes
     command     in    system_start_up.ec.      In    the     supplied
     system_start_up.ec,  a single  logical volume,  named public,  is
     selected.  This command line should be changed to select a set of
     publicly  accessible  and  permanently  mounted  logical  volumes
     containing as many physical volumes  as possible, subject to some
     constraints.   Site  maintenance  personnel  are  responsible for
     ensuring there  is always enough space available  on the selected
     logical  volumes to  hold  the  process directory  segments.  The
     process  directory placement  algorithm causes  process directory
     creations to be made on each  logical volume in proportion to the
     number of physical volumes in the logical volume.

     Ensure that enough  storage will be available.  About  5% of each
     volume is  used for the VTOC  and volume map.  In  addition, some
     breakage is unavoidable.

     Since the system handles running out of storage without crashing,
     and  since it is  possible to add  physical volumes to  a logical
     volume  dynamically, logical  volumes can  be defined  with fewer
     physical volumes than their maximum anticipated size.

     Normal response to this question  should be "ipc", "t610", "t601"
     or "t500".  However, on systems with an IMU configured the "Enter
     boot tape..."  query  will not appear.  The system  will boot the
     bootload  tape controller, if  necessary, and continue.   At this
     time, the intention to cold  boot is given.  Multics will request
     the location of the rpv.  Once this is done, the init_vol request
     loop will be entered to accept the layout of the rpv.

     Initialize each new root volume  except the RPV with the init_vol
     command.

     For  better performance,  it is   advisable to  place a  hardcore
     partition (hc) on each physical volume of the Root Logical Volume
     (RLV).  The  placement of the  hardcore partition on  each volume
     must be  low.  The recommended  size of additional  partitions is
     2500 records divided by the  number of physical volume used.  The
     RPV size should  remain 2500 records to allow the  system to boot
     with only an RPV mounted.

     For most volumes the command looks like:

          init_vol PV_NAME DRIVE_NAME  -rlv {-special}

          Example: init_vol root2 dska_02 -rlv -special

     For  those volumes  that are  to have  partitions, or  an average
     segment length  other than the  default of five  records, add the
     optional "-special"  as a third argument.  The  command then asks
     for   instructions  about   the  partition   location.   Hardcore
     partitions, for  additional root volumes, should  be specified as
     they are initialized.  You may type one or more of the following:

          part NAME low nrec
          part NAME high nrec
          avg fff.ff
          list

     complete initialization by typing:

          end

     An  example of  typing the  init_vol for  an MSS0451/400  with an
     alternate partition on a RLV drive is:

          init_vol root2 dska_02 -rlv -special
          part alt high 141    (Note: 451 disk only)
          part hc low 625      (Example: 2500/4 root volumes)
          end

     when done type:

     created automatically  by the bootload.  Since  the default model
     number  is  451,  use  the  change_vol_registration  command,  if
     necessary, to set  the correct value of model number  on the rpv.
     The serial number can also be set as follows:

     lvr -pv rpv
     cvr -pv rpv -serial 233-79 -model <model number>
     ame

     Use the init_vol for the additional logical volumes as follows:

     init_vol pub01 dska_03 -special
     part alt high 141   (Note: 451 disk only)
     end
     init_vol pub02 dska_04 -special
     part alt high 141   (Note: 451 disk only)
     end

     After  all physical volumes  are registered and  initialized, add
     them to the disk_table by typing the add_vol (av) command for all
     except the RPV:

          av pvname dskX_NN

     An example:

          av pub01 dska_03

     At this point add all of the logical volumes by typing:

          alv -all

     The  ACL for  >lv should  be set  to "s"  for all users.  Setting
     initial ACLs for segments in the >lv directory is done from admin
     mode by typing:

          M-> ! admin
          <READY MESSAGE>
          M-> ! sis >lv rew .SysAdmin rew .SysDaemon
          <READY MESSAGE>
          M-> ! sa >lv s  sma .SysAdmin sma .SysMaint
          <READY MESSAGE>

     Create  Access Control  Segments (ACS)  for each  logical volume.
     For system public volumes, create them as follows:

          M-> ! create >lv>{lvname}.acs
          <READY MESSAGE>
          M-> ! cvr -lv {lvname} -acs >lv>{lvname}.acs
          <READY MESSAGE>
          M-> ! set_max_length >lv>.acs 0

     where {lvname} stands for name of each logical volume.

     The ACLs of these segments  are interpreted to give permission to
     attach the logical volume (for private volumes) and permission to
     modify  master directory  control  information  in the  MDCS (for
     specific   logical   volumes).     Specific   ACL   entries   for
     Initializer.SysDaemon should be deleted at this time by typing:

          delete_acl >lv>.acs <READY MESSAGE>

     This  is  necessary  because  Initializer.SysDaemon  always  gets
     default access of "rw".  This  would prevent the Initializer from
     being a volume administrator by virtue of the missing "e" access.
     Deletion  of  specific  access  gives  the  Initializer the "rew"
     access allowed all SysDaemons.

     The  ACL is  now set  so that  all system  administrators and all
     SysDaemons  are  volume  administrators.   The  "e"  bit controls
     executive access.

     For private volumes, the ACS is  in a directory controlled by the
     volume owner.   The ACS segment must  reside in a directory  on a
     logical volume different from the private logical volume.

     Use the set_volume_quota command  to give the Initializer process
     enough  quota on  each logical   volume to  create the  necessary
     master directories.

          set_volume_quota LV_NAME QUOTA

     Example:  set_volume_quota public 36000

     The number  QUOTA should be at  least the total of  the quotas of
     the directories to be created in the next step.

     Use create_dir  to create master directories.  The  format of the
     command is:

          create_dir pathname -lv logical_volume -quota QQ

     where QQ <262144

          Example:  cd >library_dir_dir -lv no_backup -quota 40000
                    cd >library_dir_dir>include -lv public -quota 3000

     The acct_start_up.ec will, in step 11, create a number of project
     directories and  assign terminal quota if the  directories do not
     exist.   They  are  the  following  with  the  quota that will be
     assigned:

          >udd>SysAdmin        5000
          >udd>SysAdmin>admin  2000
          >udd>SysDaemon       5000
          >udd>Daemon          1000
          >udd>Operator         100
          >udd>Terminals         10
          >udd>HFED            5000

     Set  ACLs  and  additional  names,  as  desired,  on  all  master
     directories at this time.

     Directory quota should be set  for each master directory by those
     sites that wish to have disk charges for directory pages included
     in  monthly bills.   Those sites  not interested  in implementing
     this feature may type "ame" and  "shutdown" then skip to the next
     step.

     A  directory quota  of 1000  pages should  be sufficient  for all
     master  directories with  the exception   of >udd.   If udd  is a
     master directory it  is recommended that it be  given a directory
     quota of 100000 pages.  This  provides enough directory quota for
     100 projects at  1000 pages each.  If the site  has more than 100
     active projects the 100000 figure should be adjusted accordingly.
     To  set directory  quota on   each master  directory execute  the
     following command:

          set_dir_quota PATHNAME QQ

     This command allows a system  administrator to place an arbitrary
     secondary storage quota for directories on a specified directory.

     PATHNAME
        is the name of a directory on which the directory quota is to
        be placed.  -wd can be used to specify the working directory.
     QQ
        is the directory quota in 1024 word pages.

     If additional directory quota is  required for a master directory
     the quota can  be reset following movement of  directory quota to
     inferior directories.


     Instructions for moving directory quota down to the project level
     is included in Step 18.

     A Multics  Communications System (CS)  core image is  supplied in
     the >unbundled library, and is named site_mcs.

     The site_mcs version for this  release is 7.6.  The site_mcs core
     image contains the basic support for DN6780 type FNPs with 64k of
     memory.

     The communication system core images are built using the bind_fnp
     command in conjunction with a  bindfile describing the CS modules
     and configurations  to be used.  A copy  of the site_mcs.bind_fnp
     can be found in >ldd>mcs>info.





     Instructions - First Time      5-13                       SIB12.2


     Sites should build their own CS  core image tailored to their own
     FNP  configuration,  terminal  type   requirements,  and  use  of
     additional separately priced FNP software modules.

     Sites using the default site_mcs core image should ensure the CMF
     image statement points to the  correct default core image located
     in  >unb.  The  initial CMF,  which includes  some sample channel
     entries in comments, as well as one FNP entry, should be checked.
     Edit this  CMF to eliminate  any inconsistencies with  the actual
     configuration and add one or more entries for login channels.

     Sites modifying their  own CS core image are required  to use the
     GCOS  Environment  Simulator  which   is  an  unbundled  software
     product.  To build  a new core image, the  following procedure is
     suggested:

     Sites  will need  to extract  the communications  object segments
     from archives located in  >ldd>mcs>object.  Sites should create a
     virgin directory under >udd>sa>a for each new core image.

     The  following example  is for  sites with  the more  common type
     Datanet and a larger memory configuration.  Execute the following
     commands:

          create_dir >udd>sa>a>mcs.7.6b
          cwd >udd>sa>a>mcs.7.6b
          ted
          r >ldd>mcs>info>site_mcs.bind_fnp (or location of sites
                                              CS bind file)
          .
          .
          .
          make editing changes if any..
          .
          .
          .
          w site_mcs.bind_fnp
          q
          ac x ([segs >ldd>mcs>o>.archive -absp])
          bind_fnp site_mcs -list

     Be  sure the  image statement  in the  CMF points  to this  newly
     created CS core image.  The following example assumes the default
     CMF to be in the >udd>sa>a directory.  This procedure will insure
     that the new CS image is used:

          cwd >udd>sa>a
          ted
          r  CMF.cmf
          .
          .
          Locate the image: statement by typing:

          /image/

          Edit the image: statement to point to the CS image,
          site_mcs, by making the statement read:

          :image:  >udd>sa>a>mcs.7.6b>site_mcs;

          .
          .
          Make any other changes needed.

          q
          cv_cmf CMF.cmf
          copy CMF.cdt >sc1>cdt -force

     The  above procedure builds  a site dependent  CS core image  and
     ensures  that this image  is loaded in  the FNP by  the answering
     service.

     During this step, expect many messages, some with audible alarms,
     reporting  that  certain  segments  do  not  exist  and are being
     created.  These messages would be cause for concern during normal
     system operation  but are to be expected  during accounting start
     up and may be ignored.  Execute the following example:

          stop_mpx a  (sites with multiple FNPs execute this
                       command for each FNP)

          admin    (any error messages displayed at this time, except
                    hardware error messages can be ignored.)

          ec >tools>acct_start_up cold2

     This  procedure will  finish accounting  start up.   The load_mpx
     command indicates on the FNP  console any configuration errors if
     console_man is  loaded and "console:  yes;" is  in the bind_file.
     If any errors are reported they should be corrected.

     During   this    stage   you   will   encountered    the   error,
     "set_max_length:    Validation  level    not  in   ring  bracket.

     and .SysAdmin. may be removed.




     Instructions - First Time      5-18                       SIB12.2


     This exec_com  resets the vtoce  fields for both  incremental and
     consolidated  dumps by making  a first dump  pass with output  to
     discard_.   This  is  necessary  since  the  first  dump  pass is
     equivalent  to  a  complete  dump  on  both  the  incremental and
     consolidated  pass.  Follow  the instructions  for normal  use of
     this facility at the completion of this exec_com.

     Sites need a sufficient number of tapes to accommodate the entire
     file system  and any incremental  and consolidated dumps  until a
     subsequent  complete dump is  taken.  This is  known as a  reload
     group.  It  is suggested that new  sites start with 100  reels of
     tape  or a  sufficient quantity  to contain  two complete  reload
     groups.  A  single reel of  tape at 6250  bpi holds approximately
     26000 Multics records.

     This step is  necessary only for those sites that  wish to charge
     their user projects for disk  storage used by directory pages, or
     to obtain a more complete  disk report containing additional disk
     usage statistics.  If directory quota  is not already set on >udd
     execute the following commands from  a SysAdmin process if udd is
     not a master directory:

          sac set_dir_quota > 120000
          sac move_dir_quota >udd 100000


     If udd is a master directory, then execute:

          set_dir_quota >udd 100000

     Then execute the commands:

          cwd >udd
          move_dir_quota ([dirs *]) 1000

     These commands move or set  sufficient directory quota on udd for
     100 projects  with the suggested default  project directory quota
     of 1000.  If a site has more than 100 active projects a figure in
     excess of 100000  must be chosen for the  initial directory quota
     of udd.  The master.ec gives each new project a default directory
     quota of 1000 pages by moving  1000 pages of directory quota from
     udd.  The  system administrator should make sure  there is always
     sufficient directory quota on udd to accommodate new projects.

     It is also  suggested that all directories directly  off the root
     with the  exception of pdd and  sl1 be given nonzero  segment and
     directory quotas  large enough to accommodate  their current page
     usage and  allowing for some growth.   The purpose of this  is to
     cause the disk report to contain complete statistical information

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
