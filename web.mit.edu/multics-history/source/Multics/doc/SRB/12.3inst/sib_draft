                           INTRODUCTION




This   document   describes   the   MR12.1   package.    Detailed
instructions for installation of a  system for the first time and
upgrading to  MR12.1 from an  MR12.0 system constitute  the major
portion of this document.

No  attempt is  made to  document features  of MR12.1  other than
those directly required for its installation.

Software Releases  prior to MR12.0 are no  longer supported.  All
sites  running  pre-MR12.0  software  are  strongly encouraged to
upgrade to MR12.0 as soon as possible.

System  Representatives  who  support  Multics  should  apply for
registration  on  the  SiteSA  project  maintained  in Phoenix on
System M.

The SiteSA project was created to allow sites to communicate with
Multics  System  Support  (MSS)  personnel  on  matters  of  site
support.  MSS maintains and pays for usage on this project.  Only
System Representatives who support  a Multics site are authorized
to use the project.  They are  authorized to use it only for site
support activities which require  communication of information to
MSS personnel.

MSS would  appreciate that the  SiteSAs maintain the  site's info
segments in >udd>SiteSA>site_info  (>udd>ssa>si).  Information on
maintaining   these   segments   is    in   the   info   segment,
>udd>ssa>si>site_info.info.

In addition  to normal telephone and  Multics mail communications
with   MSS  personnel,   SiteSAs  are   encouraged  to   use  the
unusual_crash_log  forum meeting  to report  any unusual problems
encountered at  their site.  SiteSAs not familiar  with forum can
type "help  forum" for usage  information.  Forum is  a subsystem

somewhat like the mail system  in which an electronic meeting can
be held.  To invoke forum, type:

   forum >udd>ssa>sa_meeting>uclog

Type  ?  to  print a  list of  requests allowed  by forum.  Other
forum meetings of interest to SiteSAs are:

   >udd>ssa>sa_meeting>hardware_problems          hwp
   >udd>ssa>sa_meeting>critical_fixes             fixes

We would  appreciate that sites as they  complete installation of
MR12.1 enter a transaction in the install_instructions (ii) forum
meeting.   This  will  allow  other  sites  to  see the amount of
exposure the release is receiving and to communicate any problems
encountered in the installation procedure.

MSS also suggests, very strongly,  that SiteSAs DO NOT attempt to
reproduce site problems on System M  which are known to crash the
system at  their site, cause processors  to loop in ring  0, etc.
Such problems  should be reported via the  Trouble Report system,
and  will   be  verified  by  MSS   personnel  using  appropriate
resources,   so  that  System   M  service  is   not  interrupted
unnecessarily.

Problems encountered  while installing this release,  or problems
of  a critical  nature to  a customer  site (for  a definition of
critical, type:  help tr.priorities)  should be reported directly
to  MSS by  mail or   phone.  European  or Canadian  sites should
contact their  local site support  person for details  on support
from  the Canadian,  French or  UK Technical  Assistance Centers.

The  primary pathnames  on most   of the  system directories  are
somewhat lengthy.   For this document, abbreviated  (added) names
are used in  lieu of the primary name.  The  following list gives
the primary and abbreviated names used in this document.

     >daemon_dir_dir           >system_library_1
          >ddd                      >sl1

The system directories firmware and  obs, are not included in the
standard system search rules.  Segments in these directories must
either  be accessed  by absolute   pathnames or  by changing  the
system search rules via the set_system_search_rules command added
to the system_start_up.ec.

MR12.1 includes this document, a  set of magnetic tapes, hardcopy
dump maps, and accompanying  documentation.  Sites not installing
Multics for the first time will  be able to proceed to the MR12.1
release from  MR12.0.  Sites upgrading to MR12.1  from MR12 refer
to Section 4,  sites installing Multics for the  first time refer
to Section  5.  The instructions  in each section  will provide a
procedure to guide a site through the installation.

Documentation for  some of the  new features and  TRs resolved in
this release  is contained in the directory  >doc>MR12.1 which is
part of this release.

This is a total software release.   It contains a complete set of
all modules contained in the Multics standard system.

Appendix  A will  list modules  added, modified  or deleted since
MR12.0.

Appendix B contains an outline of the use of MTR under Multics.

A set of master tapes was generated for this release and all dump
maps reflect the contents of  these master tapes.  All tapes sent
to  the  field  are  copies  of  the  master  tapes.   Because of
different  lengths of magnetic  tape reels, there  may not be  an
exact correlation between a single tape and a dump map.

These differences,  if any, are  minimal and occur  only on those
sets  that are  multi-reel (e.g.,  12.1LDD_STANDARD tapes).  Site
personnel may assure  themselves of the contents of  the tapes by
visually  matching the maps  produced from the  reload operations
against the master dump maps supplied.

                     FCO AND FIRMWARE STATUS




_F_I_R_M_W_A_R_E

The firmware identification for MR12.1 is "IFAD C.3".


IFAD (Integrated Firmware and Diagnostics) tapes, are distributed
to all sites having  valid Field Engineering Hardware Maintenance
contracts.  The IFAD C.3 tape is distributed as FCO PHAFGA726.


T&D  (Test and  Diagnostic) tapes,  are distributed  to all sites
having  valid Field  Engineering Hardware  Maintenance contracts.
The T&D tape is distributed as FCO PHAFGA888, rev.  B.2.


This version of  IFAD, firmware, and T&D modules  has been tested
and exposed on System M in  Phoenix.  The modules are supplied as
part of the  MR12.1 release and can be found  in >ldd>firmware as
part of the LDD_STANDARD tape.  When subsequent IFAD tapes become
available,   it   is   recommended   that   the   site   use  the
deckfile_manager,  dfm, command  to load  the released  IFAD tape
into >system_library_tandd.  The firmware  modules should then be
moved  to >ldd>firmware and  a new MST  tape should be  generated
using generate_mst.


The  MR12.1  release  requires  the  following  firmware revision
levels.


            Disc:  DSC191 -- U1
                   DSC500 -- V1
                   MSP800 -- F1

            Tape:  MTC0500 -- V1

The following list of FCOs should be thought of as a continuation
of the  similar list for  MR12.0.  Sites that  are upgrading from
MR12.0 will need  to verify that FCOs for that  release have been
installed.

As FCOs are completed in Phoenix,  they are sent out to the field
sites.   Some of  the FCOs  affect only  site documentation while
others may  change the hardware to improve  system reliability or
maintainability.   An example  might be  a change  to improve the
supply  of cooling  air to  some boards  so that  the boards  run
cooler  and are therefore  less likely to  fail.  These types  of
FCOs are important to the  long-term success of system operation.
However,  because these  FCOs are   not required  to correct  the
results of any computer program, they are not listed in this SRB.

The purpose of this section is to identify those FCOs that are of
utmost  importance in  the short  term.  This  list includes only
those FCOs needed to correct a program malfunction.

For those FCOs already sent to the field, the "FCO Kit Ship Date"
column  contains the  approximate date  when shipment  of the FCO
kits began.


One of the  column headings in the tables on  the following pages
is "Round Robin".  The implications of a "Yes" in this column for
a particular FCO are as follows:

1.   The FCO kit  includes at least one board.   The new board(s)
     is to replace the board(s) now in the equipment.

2.   Enough FCO kits are put together  for about 20% of the sites
     that are to take part in  the Round Robin.  Some FCOs result
     in a Round Robin for all  sites.  Other FCOs involve a Round
     Robin for some sites but  not for other sites.  For example,
     two  of  the  factors  that   determine  whether  or  not  a
     particular site takes part in a Round Robin FCO are:

     a.   The date codes of certain integrated circuit chips on a
          board.

     b.   The   board  construction    method  --   wirewrap  vs.
          multilayer.




Firmware Status                3-2                        SIB12.1


3.   The  set of  FCO kits  are sent  to the  first set of sites.
     (For the  remainder of this  discussion, we will  follow one
     kit as it makes its Round Robin journey.)

4.   The site installs the FCO.   When the site is satisfied that
     the FCO  is satisfactory, the site returns  the old board(s)
     to Phoenix.

5.   If there is still equipment at other sites that have not had
     the  FCO  installed,  the  returned  board(s)  is  reworked,
     tested, and another FCO kit is assembled in Phoenix and sent
     to the next site.

6.   Since the length  of time it takes a site  to install an FCO
     and become satisfied that it  is working correctly cannot be
     known in advance,  there is no way to  predict with accuracy
     how long it will be until  the FCO has been installed at all
     sites.


The FCOs have been classified into the following categories:


_C_A_T_E_G_O_R_Y__1 - The  new  software  for  this  release  will not run
             properly unless these FCOs are installed.


_C_A_T_E_G_O_R_Y__2 - The new software for this release may or may not run
             properly  if these  FCOs are  not installed.   It is
             strongly recomended to have  these FCOs installed to
             improve reliability of the system.


_C_A_T_E_G_O_R_Y__3 - FCOs whose  effects are program-visible, but  do not
             fall  into  categories  1  or  2.   Category  3 FCOs
             correct  problems that  are not  uniquely related to
             this release.

      INSTRUCTIONS FOR SITES UPDATING TO MR12.1 FROM MR12.0




If  problems are encountered  in any of  the Steps listed  below,
return  to the  last step  known to  be successful  and retry the
Steps.   Pay  particular  attention  to  procedure.   This entire
procedure was verified on the  Multics System at Phoenix Computer
Operations, but some hardware/software differences may exist at a
particular site.

In  this section, two  formats of text  are used to  indicate the
typing of input into the system.  This input usually is a command
line, but  could be data  typed in response  to a query  from the
operator console.

Strings of input, and output messages of importance are indicated
on separate lines.

In addition, all input to the system is to be typed in lowercase,
except  when indicated  by the  occurrence of  both uppercase and
lowercase  in the  input line.    User input  is preceeded  by an
exclamation mark (!).

System display output  is shown as is, except  when the displayed
line  exceeds the  page margins   for this  document.  When  this
occurs,  the displayed  line is  split into  two lines,  with the
second line indented from the first.

For this release  there are minor changes to  the admin.ec system
exec_com.  It is recommended that  sites merge these changes with
their site  specific version prior to proceeding  with this step.
Sites may optionally wait until after MR12.1 is installed if they
choose.

It is recommended  that sites perform a BCE SAVE.   A double save
is recommended to avoid any possible tape problems later.

Due to the  method by which unbundled software  is dumped, normal
trimming  during reloading  of new  software does  not occur.  To
ensure that unbundled directories are clean execute the following
before shutting  down MR12.0 for  the last time  enter admin mode
and type:

     cwd >system_library_unbundled
     answer yes -bf hpdl ([files **])
     cwd >library_dir_dir>unbundled>source
     answer yes -bf hpdl ([files **])

Place  the new  MR12.1 Mult  tape on  any convenient  tape drive.
Initialize and boot the MST.

The system will boot the  bootload tape controller, if necessary,
and continue.   At this time you  will be asked to  input the RPV
location in channel, controller, device and unit number format:

to  display the  entire config   deck as  currently saved  in the
"conf" partition.

After having made necessary changes exit the editor by typing "w"
and "q".

The "w"  request will verify  card syntax.  The  "q" request will
leave the qedx editor and place the user at the bce(early) level.

At this point the libraries  will be reloaded.  The release tapes
should   be   reloaded   in   this   specific   sequence:   EXEC,
LDD_STANDARD, UNB, and MISC.

To reload the libraries type:

     reload_system_release -nosetlvid

When the system asks "Input tape label:" type:  <reel_id>

where <reel_id> is the reel identification specified for the next
tape  to  be  reloaded.   See  Section  2,  "Contents  of  MR12.1
Package," for  a listing of  all "Tape names".   Repeat this step
for each library tape.

When all tapes are loaded, type:

A  new  standard  TTF  has  been  provided  containing additional
terminal types.  Sites using a modified site dependent TTF should
merge these changes with their  modified version, and convert the
TTF  to its  binary version.   The converted  binary version must
then be installed to take  effect.  The TTF.ttf segment in >tools
contains  some of  the more   common used  terminals on  Multics.
Sites  using the default  TTF for this  release must execute  the
following commands to perform this conversion:

     cwd >udd>sa>a
     rename TTF.ttf TTF.save
     cp >t>TTF.ttf
     cv_ttf TTF
     install TTF.ttt

A Multics  Communications System (CS)  core image is  supplied in
the >unbundled library, and  is named "site_mcs".  The "site_mcs"
core image contains  the basic support for DN6780  type FNPs with
64k of memory.

CS  core   images  are  built  using  the   bind_fnp  command  in
conjunction  with  a  bindfile  describing  the  CS  modules  and
configurations to  be used.  A copy of  the site_mcs.bind_fnp can
be found in >ldd>mcs>info.




Instructions - Updating        4-5                        SIB12.1


Sites should build their own CS  core image tailored to their own
FNP  configuration,  terminal  type   requirements,  and  use  of
additional separately  priced FNP software modules.   Sites using
the  default "site_mcs" core  image should skip  to Step 7  after
ensuring  the CMF image  statement points to  the core image  now
located in >unb.

To build a new core image, the following procedure is suggested:

Sites  will need  to extract  the communications  object segments
from archives located in  >ldd>mcs>object.  Sites should create a
virgin directory under >udd>sa>a for each new core image.

The  following example  is for  sites with  the more  common type
Datanet and a larger memory configuration.  Execute the following
commands:

     create_dir >udd>sa>a>mcs.7.6
     cwd >udd>sa>a>mcs.7.6
     qx
     r >ldd>mcs>info>site_mcs.bind_fnp (or location of sites
                                         CS bind file)
     .
     .
     .
     make editing changes if any..
     .
     .
     .
     w site_mcs.bind_fnp
     q
     ac x ([segs >ldd>mcs>o>*.archive -absp])
     bind_fnp site_mcs -list

Be  sure the  image statement  in the  CMF points  to this  newly
created CS core image.  The name  of the CMF requires a suffix of
"cmf".   The  following  example  assumes  the  CMF  to be in the
>udd>sa>a directory.  This procedure will  insure that the new CS
image is used:

     cwd >udd>sa>a

     qx
r  CMF.cmf
.
.
1) Edit the image: statement to point to the new CS image.
2) Make any other changes needed.
.
.
w CMF.cmf
q

     cv_cmf CMF
     copy CMF.cdt >system_control_1>cdt -force

The  above procedure builds  a site dependent  CS core image  and
ensures  that this image  is loaded in  the FNP by  the answering
service.

Exit admin mode by typing "ame".  Then issue the commands:

     stop_mpx a        (sites  with  multiple  FNPs  execute this
                       command for each FNP)
     multics

     load_mpx a -check (sites  with  multiple  FNPs  execute this
                       command for each FNP)
     go

The   load_mpx  command   indicates  on   the  FNP   console  any
configuration  errors  if  console_man  is  loaded  and "console:
yes;"  is in  the bind_file.    If any  errors are  reported they
should be corrected.

Sites should  assure the correct  version number is  reported the
first time the FNP is booted.

Check  the  ACLs  for  >sss>dm_admin_gate_, >sss>dm_daemon_gate_,
>tools>installation_tools_,               >tools>pnt_admin_gate_,
>tools>pnt_login_gate_,                 >tools>pnt_network_gate_,
>tools>pnt_priv_gate_, >sss>metering_gate_ and >sss>queue_admin_.
The ACLs on these gates are as they appear on System M and should
be restricted.   The ACL for  these gates are  site dependent and
should be changed to meet  each site's needs.  The dm_admin_gate_
and  dm_daemon_gate_  should  be  restricted  to  data management
administrators or daemons.   The installations_tools_ gate should
be restricted to system library  maintainers.  All persons on the
ACL for metering_gate_ have access  to the Multics metering data.
All  persons on the  ACL for queue_admin_  are permitted to  move
absentee and  daemon requests for  themselves and other  users to
different queues.   Users not on this  ACL are only able  to move
their  own  requests.   The   Initializer  must  have  access  to
queue_admin_.   This  capability  is  also  dependent on extended
access to the <queue>.ms  segments.  The various pnt_<name>_gate_
acls should  be restricted to the following  minimums for correct
system operation:

       >t>pnt_admin_gate_
     re    *.SysDaemon.*
     re    *.SysAdmin.*

In MR12.1 a new method for controlling the ability to specify the
processors  a process  can run   on has  been defined.   This new
method uses the ACL on a new set_proc_required.acs segment and no
longer requires phcs_ privilege.  Execute the following commands:

     create set_proc_required.acs
     set_acl set_proc_required.acs rw *.SysDaemon rw *.SysAdmin rw *.SysMiant -rp

The  system  is  now  ready  for  normal  operation under MR12.1.
Following  a  reasonable  period   of  MR12.1  operation,  it  is
suggested that  sites delete any <name.save>  segments created as
part  of  this  procedure.   It  is  also  recommended that sites
salvage    their    systems    and    fix    quota   by   running
Salvager.SysDaemon, executing the following command:

         INSTRUCTIONS FOR SITES INSTALLING FOR FIRST TIME




The following  basic procedure must be  performed when installing
Multics for the first time.


_S_T_E_P _1_:  _P_R_E_P_A_R_A_T_I_O_N


Ensure that all Multics active hardware components run error free
in  Multics  mode  using  the  latest  T&D  release.   Peripheral
equipment can be run in either Multics or GCOS mode and must also
run error free.

Carefully  check  the  hardware  configuration  (port and channel
assignments,  mailbox switch  settings, etc.)   Create and verify
the configuration  description on paper for later  input when BCE
is  running.  Close  consultation  between  the SiteSA  and Field
Engineering representative  is of the utmost  importance.  (Refer
to Section 9  and Appendix A of the Operator's  Guide to Multics,
Order  Number  GB61,  for  hardware  switch  setting information.
Refer to Section 7 of  the Multics System Maintenance Procedures,
Order Number AM81-03, for configuration setup.)

When selecting the  storage unit for the RPV, select  a disk unit
with as few bad tracks as possible.  For the MSS451s, T&Ds should
be used to format  and test the first disk to be  used as the RPV
(test 365, subtest 26).

The MSS500/501s are formatted  at the factory, however, selection
of alternate tracks  is not done at the factory.   It can only be
done using  MTR at Multics  command level.  (Refer  to Appendix B
for an outline of how MTR runs under Multics.)

Other logical volumes may be set up for specific applications.

The  assignment  decision  requires  the  system administrator to
balance the  costs of seek interference and  breakage against the
advantages  of  being  able   to  define  and  process  logically
different collections  of data.  Data  bases used for  only a few
hours a day or only a few days a month are natural candidates for
allocation  to  a  separate  logical  volume.   Breaking  up  the
system's  storage into  several logical  volumes also  allows the
site to  operate without all logical volumes  mounted if hardware
goes down.  For example, an MPC or channel might go down, halving
the system's disk drive capacity.

These particular assignments give a wide range of flexibility and
Multics  can run with  only the root  logical volume mounted,  or
with one or two of the  less critical logical volumes not mounted
due  to  unavailability  of  disk  drives.   For example, logical
volumes, list_1 and list_2, can  easily be demounted.  This frees
two disk drives to be available  for use with other more critical
logical volumes.

Installations  that wish  to use  the Access  Isolation Mechanism
(AIM)  by specifying more  than one access  category (sensitivity
level) should specify the maximum  and minimum categories for one
or more volumes  and thus ensure that sensitive  data is confined
to  a  few  packs,  or  that  packs  are  not "contaminated" with
information requiring special precautions.

The logical volumes that hold  process directory segments must be
chosen.   Because  of  the   heavy  usage  of  process  directory
segments, these  segments should be spread over  as many physical
volumes as possible.  One or more logical volumes may be selected
to  hold process  directory segments,  using the set_pdir_volumes
command     in    system_start_up.ec.      In    the     supplied
system_start_up.ec,  a single  logical volume,  named public,  is
selected.  This command line should be changed to select a set of
publicly  accessible  and  permanently  mounted  logical  volumes
containing as many physical volumes  as possible, subject to some
constraints.   Site  maintenance  personnel  are  responsible for
ensuring there  is always enough space available  on the selected
logical  volumes to  hold  the  process directory  segments.  The
process  directory placement  algorithm causes  process directory
creations to be made on each  logical volume in proportion to the
number of physical volumes in the logical volume.

Ensure that enough  storage will be available.  About  5% of each
volume is  used for the VTOC  and volume map.  In  addition, some
breakage is unavoidable.

Since the system handles running out of storage without crashing,
and  since it is  possible to add  physical volumes to  a logical
volume  dynamically, logical  volumes can  be defined  with fewer
physical volumes than their maximum anticipated size.

necessary,  and continue.   At this  time, the  intention to cold
boot  is given.  Multics  will request the  location of the  rpv.
Once this is  done, the init_vol request loop will  be entered to

Initialize each new root volume  except the RPV with the init_vol
command.

For  better performance,  it is   advisable to  place a  hardcore
partition (hc) on each physical volume of the Root Logical Volume
(RLV).  The  placement of the  hardcore partition on  each volume
must be  low.  The recommended  size of additional  partitions is
2500 records divided by the  number of physical volume used.  The
RPV size should  remain 2500 records to allow the  system to boot
with only an RPV mounted.

For most volumes the command looks like:

     init_vol PV_NAME DRIVE_NAME  -rlv {-special}

     Example: init_vol root2 dska_02 -rlv -special

For  those volumes  that are  to have  partitions, or  an average
segment length  other than the  default of five  records, add the
optional "-special"  as a third argument.  The  command then asks
for   instructions  about   the  partition   location.   Hardcore
partitions, for  additional root volumes, should  be specified as
they are initialized.  You may type one or more of the following:

     part NAME low nrec
     part NAME high nrec
     avg fff.ff
     list

complete initialization by typing:

     end

An  example of  typing the  init_vol for  an MSS0451/400  with an
alternate partition on a RLV drive is:

     init_vol root2 dska_02 -rlv -special
     part alt high 141    (Note: 451 disk only)
     part hc low 625      (Example: 2500/4 root volumes)

Register and initialize all non-RLV volumes.  For ease of typing,
use of lower case names is recommended.

Use the add_volume_registration (avr) command as in the following
example:

     ! avr -pv pub01 -lv public -serial 233-81 -model 451
     add_volume_registration: LV "public" does not exist.  Do you
          wish to create it? M-> ! yes

     r 12:45  1.473 8

to  create registration  entries  for  each logical  and physical
volume.   The registration  file for  the root  logical volume is
created automatically  by the bootload.  Since  the default model
number  is  451,  use  the  change_vol_registration  command,  if
necessary, to set  the correct value of model number  on the rpv.
The serial number can also be set as follows:

lvr -pv rpv
cvr -pv rpv -serial 233-79 -model <model number>
ame

Use the init_vol for the additional logical volumes as follows:

init_vol pub01 dska_03 -special
part alt high 141   (Note: 451 disk only)
end
init_vol pub02 dska_04 -special
part alt high 141   (Note: 451 disk only)
end

After  all physical volumes  are registered and  initialized, add
them to the disk_table by typing the add_vol (av) command for all
except the RPV:

     av pvname dskX_NN

An example:

     av pub01 dska_03

At this point add all of the logical volumes by typing:

     alv -all

The  ACL for  >lv should  be set  to "s"  for all users.  Setting
initial ACLs for segments in the >lv directory is done from admin
mode by typing:

     M-> ! admin
     <READY MESSAGE>
     M-> ! sis >lv rew *.SysAdmin rew *.SysDaemon
     <READY MESSAGE>
     M-> ! sa >lv s * sma *.SysAdmin sma *.SysMaint
     <READY MESSAGE>

Create  Access Control  Segments (ACS)  for each  logical volume.
For system public volumes, create them as follows:

     M-> ! create >lv>{lvname}.acs
     <READY MESSAGE>
     M-> ! cvr -lv {lvname} -acs >lv>{lvname}.acs
     <READY MESSAGE>
     M-> ! set_max_length >lv>*.acs 0

where {lvname} stands for name of each logical volume.

The ACLs of these segments  are interpreted to give permission to
attach the logical volume (for private volumes) and permission to
modify  master directory  control  information  in the  MDCS (for
specific   logical   volumes).     Specific   ACL   entries   for
Initializer.SysDaemon should be deleted at this time by typing:

     delete_acl >lv>*.acs <READY MESSAGE>

This  is  necessary  because  Initializer.SysDaemon  always  gets
default access of "rw".  This  would prevent the Initializer from
being a volume administrator by virtue of the missing "e" access.
Deletion  of  specific  access  gives  the  Initializer the "rew"
access allowed all SysDaemons.

The  ACL is  now set  so that  all system  administrators and all
SysDaemons  are  volume  administrators.   The  "e"  bit controls
executive access.

For private volumes, the ACS is  in a directory controlled by the
volume owner.   The ACS segment must  reside in a directory  on a
logical volume different from the private logical volume.

Use the set_volume_quota command  to give the Initializer process
enough  quota on  each logical   volume to  create the  necessary
master directories.

     set_volume_quota LV_NAME QUOTA

Example:  set_volume_quota public 36000

The number  QUOTA should be at  least the total of  the quotas of
the directories to be created in the next step.

Use create_dir  to create master directories.  The  format of the
command is:

     create_dir pathname -lv logical_volume -quota QQ

where QQ <262144

     Example:  cd >library_dir_dir -lv no_backup -quota 40000
               cd >library_dir_dir>include -lv public -quota 3000

The acct_start_up.ec will, in step 11, create a number of project
directories and  assign terminal quota if the  directories do not
exist.   They  are  the  following  with  the  quota that will be
assigned:

     >udd>SysAdmin        5000
     >udd>SysAdmin>admin  2000
     >udd>SysDaemon       5000
     >udd>Daemon          1000

     >udd>Terminals         10
     >udd>HFED            5000

Set  ACLs  and  additional  names,  as  desired,  on  all  master
directories at this time.

Directory quota should be set  for each master directory by those
sites that wish to have disk charges for directory pages included
in  monthly bills.   Those sites  not interested  in implementing
this feature may type "ame" and  "shutdown" then skip to the next
step.

A  directory quota  of 1000  pages should  be sufficient  for all
master  directories with  the exception   of >udd.   If udd  is a
master directory it  is recommended that it be  given a directory
quota of 100000 pages.  This  provides enough directory quota for
100 projects at  1000 pages each.  If the site  has more than 100
active projects the 100000 figure should be adjusted accordingly.
To  set directory  quota on   each master  directory execute  the
following command:

     set_dir_quota PATHNAME QQ

This command allows a system  administrator to place an arbitrary
secondary storage quota for directories on a specified directory.

PATHNAME
   is the name of a directory on which the directory quota is to
   be placed.  -wd can be used to specify the working directory.
QQ
   is the directory quota in 1024 word pages.

If additional directory quota is  required for a master directory
the quota can  be reset following movement of  directory quota to
inferior directories.


Instructions for moving directory quota down to the project level
is included in Step 18.

To shut down do the following:

     ame
     shut

Reboot Multics  to ring-1 and reload  the MR12.1.LDD_STANDARD and
MR12.1.UNBUNDLED tapes with the following commands:

          boot
          alv -all
          reload -nosetlvid

The tape labeled MR12.1.MISC must be the final tape of the MR12.1
supplied set to be reloaded.

After all the release tapes  have been reloaded cross into ring-4
by executing the following commands:

     standard
     admin   [Ignore messages from admin at this time.]

At  this   time  you  are  ready   to  execute  part  1   of  the
acct_start_up.ec.  To do this type:

ec >system_library_tools>acct_start_up cold F.ANSS

where F.ANSS  is the channel number of  the hardwired Initializer
terminal.

          F = FNP number (a-h)
          A = Adaptor type (h = hsla)
          N = Adaptor number (0-2 for hsla)
         SS = Decimal subchannel number of specified adaptor

The string "F.ANSS"  should be replaced by "otw_" if  there is no
hardwired terminal and the bootload console  is to be used as the
Initializer terminal.

At  this point,  tapes dumped   from other  Multics sites  can be
reloaded as  desired using the "reload" command  with the control
arguments  "-noquota  -notrim  -nosetlvid"  to  avoid deletion of
existing segments  and resetting of quotas.  If  any segments are
to be loaded  into ring 1 then it cannot  be done without exiting
admin mode and rebooting to ring 1.

A Multics  Communications System (CS)  core image is  supplied in
the >unbundled library, and is named site_mcs.

The site_mcs version for this  release is 7.6.  The site_mcs core
image contains the basic support for DN6780 type FNPs with 64k of
memory.

The communication system core images are built using the bind_fnp
command in conjunction with a  bindfile describing the CS modules
and configurations  to be used.  A copy  of the site_mcs.bind_fnp
can be found in >ldd>mcs>info.

Sites should build their own CS  core image tailored to their own
FNP  configuration,  terminal  type   requirements,  and  use  of
additional separately priced FNP software modules.

Sites using the default site_mcs core image should ensure the CMF
image statement points to the  correct default core image located


Instructions - First Time      5-13                       SIB12.1


in  >unb.  The  initial CMF,  which includes  some sample channel
entries in comments, as well as one FNP entry, should be checked.
Edit this  CMF to eliminate  any inconsistencies with  the actual
configuration and add one or more entries for login channels.

Sites modifying their  own CS core image are required  to use the
GCOS  Environment  Simulator  which   is  an  unbundled  software
product.  To build  a new core image, the  following procedure is
suggested:

Sites  will need  to extract  the communications  object segments
from archives located in  >ldd>mcs>object.  Sites should create a
virgin directory under >udd>sa>a for each new core image.

The  following example  is for  sites with  the more  common type
Datanet and a larger memory configuration.  Execute the following
commands:

     create_dir >udd>sa>a>mcs.7.6
     cwd >udd>sa>a>mcs.7.6
     qx
     r >ldd>mcs>info>site_mcs.bind_fnp (or location of sites
                                         CS bind file)
     .
     .
     .
     make editing changes if any..
     .
     .
     .
     w site_mcs.bind_fnp
     q
     ac x ([segs >ldd>mcs>o>*.archive -absp])
     bind_fnp site_mcs -list

Be  sure the  image statement  in the  CMF points  to this  newly
created CS core image.  The following example assumes the default
CMF to be in the >udd>sa>a directory.  This procedure will insure
that the new CS image is used:

     cwd >udd>sa>a
     qx
     r  CMF.cmf
     .
     .
     Edit the image: statement to point to the CS image.
     Make any other changes needed.
     .
     .
     w CMF.cmf
     q
     cv_cmf CMF.cmf
     copy CMF.cdt >sc1>cdt -force

The  above procedure builds  a site dependent  CS core image  and
ensures  that this image  is loaded in  the FNP by  the answering
service.

During this step, expect many messages, some with audible alarms,
reporting  that  certain  segments  do  not  exist  and are being
created.  These messages would be cause for concern during normal
system operation  but are to be expected  during accounting start
up and may be ignored.  Execute the following example:

     ame
     stop_mpx a  (sites with multiple FNPs execute this
                  command for each FNP)
     multics
     load_mpx a -check  (sites with multiple FNPs execute
                         this command for each FNP)
     admin    (any error messages displayed at this time, except
               hardware error messages can be ignored.)

     ec >tools>acct_start_up cold2

This  procedure will  finish accounting  start up.   The load_mpx
command indicates on the FNP  console any configuration errors if
console_man is  loaded and "console:  yes;" is  in the bind_file.
If any errors are reported they should be corrected.

A default start_up.ec  is available for use by  new Multics users
when they first  log in.  This exec_com is executed  by users who
login to  the system without their own  start_up.ec.  The segment
>tools>start_up.ec was copied into  >sc1 by the acct_start_up.ec.
Individual  sites can  modify this   exec_com to  meet their  own
needs.  The access  for the segment should be "r  *.*.*" and ring
brackets  of 4,5,5.  To  start the system  up for normal  service
type:

     ame
     word login
     abs start
     go

After typing "go"  a number of messages will  be returned.  These
messages are of the form:

absentee_utility_:  Entry not found.  Creating new <pathname>.

These messages may be ignored.

Type  "admin" and  enter the   new admin  password you  selected.
Check  the  ACLs  for  >sss>dm_admin_gate_, >sss>dm_daemon_gate_,
>tools>installation_tools_,               >tools>pnt_admin_gate_,
>tools>pnt_login_gate_,                 >tools>pnt_network_gate_,
>tools>pnt_priv_gate_, >sss>metering_gate_ and >sss>queue_admin_.
The ACLs on these gates are as they appear on System M and should
be restricted.   The ACL for  these gates are  site dependent and
should be changed to meet  each site's needs.  The dm_admin_gate_
and  dm_daemon_gate_  should  be  restricted  to  data management
administrators or daemons.   The installations_tools_ gate should
be restricted to system library  maintainers.  All persons on the
ACL for metering_gate_ have access  to the Multics metering data.
All  persons on the  ACL for queue_admin_  are permitted to  move
absentee and  daemon requests for  themselves and other  users to
different queues.   Users not on this  ACL are only able  to move
their  own  requests.   The   Initializer  must  have  access  to
queue_admin_.   This  capability  is  also  dependent on extended
access to the <queue>.ms  segments.  The various pnt_<name>_gate_
acls should  be restricted to the following  minimums for correct
system operation:

       >t>pnt_admin_gate_
     re    *.SysDaemon.*
     re    *.SysAdmin.*

       >t>pnt_fs_gate_
     re    *.*.*

Set  ACLs on  the >sc1>rcp  directory and  on the  access control
segments in it (<name>.acs), to allow users to attach tape drives
and any other peripherals they are allowed to use.

After all ACLs are set, type:

Type "logout  * *" and "shutdown".  After  a successful shutdown,
do a BCE save.  For further information see >doc>ss>bce>save.info

Following the bce  save, reboot the system for  normal service by
typing "boot star".  The system  is now ready for registration of
projects   and   users   from   a   SysAdmin   process,  such  as
Repair.SysAdmin, logged in from a standard terminal.

The  acct_start_up exec_com  created default  system_start_up.ec,
admin.ec,  iod_tables.iodt,  RTMF.rtmf,   and  CMF.cmf  segments.
These segments  should be tailored by  the local Site SA  to meet
site operational and configuration requirements.

The  following instructions  are necessary  only for  those sites
that intend to use the Volume Backup/Reloader facility:

The    personids    "Volume_Dumper",    "Volume_Reloader",    and
"Volume_Retriever"   are   registered.    These   personids   are
registered  on the  Daemon project   with the  multip and  daemon
attributes        and       with       a        home_dir       of
>user_dir_dir>Daemon>Volume_Dumper.  Sites using AIM must set the
authorization for these personids  at system_high and upgrade the
home_dir at system_high.

Login Repair  SysDaemon, or if  running in special  session using
the Initializer, execute the following command:

     ec >tools>setup_volume_reloader

The error message that Volumes dm001 and dm002 are not registered
should  be  ignored.   This  exec_com  creates  all  directories,
segments, and  message segments necessary for  running the volume
dumper/reloader system.  This exec_com also sets suggested access
on the directories and segments  created.  Not all the access set
is  required.    If  a  site  wishes,  the   access  created  for
*.SysMaint.* and *.SysAdmin.* may be removed.

This exec_com  resets the vtoce  fields for both  incremental and
consolidated  dumps by making  a first dump  pass with output  to
discard_.   This  is  necessary  since  the  first  dump  pass is


Instructions - First Time      5-17                       SIB12.1


equivalent  to  a  complete  dump  on  both  the  incremental and
consolidated  pass.  Follow  the instructions  for normal  use of
this facility at the completion of this exec_com.

Sites need a sufficient number of tapes to accommodate the entire
file system  and any incremental  and consolidated dumps  until a
subsequent  complete dump is  taken.  This is  known as a  reload
group.  It  is suggested that new  sites start with 100  reels of
tape  or a  sufficient quantity  to contain  two complete  reload
groups.  A  single reel of  tape at 6250  bpi holds approximately
26000 Multics records.


_S_T_E_P _1_8_:  _S_E_T_U_P _D_I_R_E_C_T_O_R_Y _Q_U_O_T_A


This step is  necessary only for those sites that  wish to charge
their user projects for disk  storage used by directory pages, or
to obtain a more complete  disk report containing additional disk
usage statistics.  If directory quota  is not already set on >udd
execute the following commands from  a SysAdmin process if udd is
not a master directory:

     sac set_dir_quota > 120000
     sac move_dir_quota >udd 100000


If udd is a master directory, then execute:

     set_dir_quota >udd 100000

Then execute the commands:

     cwd >udd
     move_dir_quota ([dirs **]) 1000

These commands move or set  sufficient directory quota on udd for
100 projects  with the suggested default  project directory quota
of 1000.  If a site has more than 100 active projects a figure in
excess of 100000  must be chosen for the  initial directory quota
of udd.  The master.ec gives each new project a default directory
quota of 1000 pages by moving  1000 pages of directory quota from
udd.  The  system administrator should make sure  there is always
sufficient directory quota on udd to accommodate new projects.

It is also  suggested that all directories directly  off the root
with the  exception of pdd and  sl1 be given nonzero  segment and
directory quotas  large enough to accommodate  their current page
usage and  allowing for some growth.   The purpose of this  is to
cause the disk report to contain complete statistical information
on these directories (directories with  0 quotas are omitted from
the disk report).

                            APPENDIX B


                    FORMATTING DISKS WITH MTR




This  appendix describes  a procedure  for formatting  disk packs
using the Media Test Routines  (MTRs).  The procedure utilizes an
annotated script  which shows typical input  and output.  Because
the  formatting procedures  differ for  MSU0451 and  MSU0500/0501
devices,  separate scripts are  provided.  In the  scripts, input
typed by the user is preceded by a ox (bullet).


_F_O_R_M_A_T_T_I_N_G _M_S_U_0_4_5_1 _D_I_S_K _P_A_C_K_S

The following script shows how to run MTR tests 6 and 3 to format
and test an MSU0451 disk pack, and to assign alternates to tracks
found defective during testing.

 1.  Enter the Total OnLine Test System (TOLTS):

ox bound_tolts_$tolts_

  ***tolts executive version 810301 on 820812 at 20.071

 2.  Enter the MPC OnLine Test Subsystem (MOLTS):

  ***enter "polts", "molts", "colts", "isolts", "quit", or "msg"
  ???  ox molts

 3.  List  the  disk  configuration  for  the  disk  string which
     formatting will be done
      (because of page constraints,  the following message is not
     an exact copy of that which is displayed by the system):

  ???  ox test pcd

  peripheral configuration:

  dska 451 16 units; starting with device no. 1
   020xx   primary channel of 4 logical channels on mpc mspa
   026xx   secondary channel of 4 logical channels on mpc mspa
   124xx   secondary channel of 4 logical channels on mpc mspb
   122xx   secondary channel of 4 logical channels on mpc mspb



 4.  Enter MTR test 6 to format and test the MSU0451 device:

  ??? ox test mmt12020t6

     where  "test mmt12020t6"  is a  sample of  the input  format
     "test mmtICCDDtT":

        mmt  identifies the MTR test package

        ICC  gives the IOM number (0 = IOM A, 1 = IOM B, etc) and
             channel  number (in decimal)  of a channel  by which
             the  device to  be formatted  can be  addressed.  It
             must be  one of those  shown in the  output of "test
             pcd" in step 3.  In the sample input above, "120" is
             IOM B, channel 20.

        DD   gives the  device number (in decimal)  of the device
             to be tested.  In the  sample input, it is device 20
             (dskb_20).

        T    gives the number of the MTR test to be run.  In this
             case, test 6 should be run to format/test a pack.

 5.  The following output describes steps  taken by MTR test 6 to
     attach the disk drive and mount the pack for writing:

  ***molts executive versions 820601 820701 on 820812 at 19.97

  the test will format all tracks on the pack.  format will
  defined by device type.  bad tracks will be marked defective
  (no alt.  assigned).
  **0(mmt12020)
  system device code = .ds450

 6.  Answer MTR  initialization questions (not a  restart, normal
     formatting, and use 3 write patterns during testing):

  **0(mmt12020)
  is this a restart?  enter (y or n) - ox n
  **0(mmt12020)
  select (f)ast or (n)ormal format?  (f)ast format is designed
  for data security erase and/or test purposes.  (n)ormal format
  is designed for disk packs that are going to be used in systems
  applications.  enter (f or n) - ox n
  **0(mmt12020)
  select from "1" to "7" write patterns?  enter (1 thru 7) - ox 3

 7.  At this point, formatting of the pack begins:

  **0(mmt12020)
  ***** begin disk pack format *****

 8.  After the  message in Step  7 is displayed,  press the BREAK
     key to interrupt formatting  operations.  When MOLTS prompts
     for  input,  set  test   options  to:   report  the  current
     cylinder/head (CCC/HH) address; display CCC/HH for transient
     errors;  report  test  progress  every  100  cylinders, with
     summary reports attached.

  ox <PRESS BREAK KEY>
  ???  ox test momt12020.r

      where "test momt12020.r" is a sample of the input format
      "test momtICCDD.O":

        momt    identifies request to set options

        ICCDD   are the IOM, Channel  and Device numbers given in
                Step 4.

        .r      is  the first  option, to  report current  CCC/HH
                location.

     Set the remaining options when prompted:

  *0(mmt12020) t6 enter options:  ox .i
  *0(mmt12020) t6 enter options:  ox .e
  *0(mmt12020) t6 enter options:  ox .s
  *0(mmt12020) t6 enter options:  ox .t
  *0(mmt12020) t6 enter options:  ox .go

 9.  When the  .go option is entered  in Step 8, MTR  reports the
     current location being formatted  and displays the defective
     tracks  found.   It  then  asks  if  you  want  to  continue
     formatting:

  **0(mmt12020)
  format function current addr. = 007/00
  **0(mmt12020)
  format function current addr. = 007/00
  **0(mmt12020)
  ***** rmc6 - summary report *****
  no tracks were formatted defective
  **0(mmt12020)
  do you want the test to continue?  enter (y or n) - ox y

10.  After  every  100  cylinders  are  formatted,  MTR  displays
     defective  tracks  found.   For  example,  the final summary
     displayed just before formatting completes, looks like:

  **0(mmt12020)

The following script shows how to run MTR tests 6 and 7 to format
and  test  an  MSU0500  or  MSU0501  disk  drive,  and  to assign
alternates to tracks found defective during testing.

The MPC normally  treats an MSU0500 or MSU0501 disk  drive as two
separately addressable  devices.  However, MTR formats  and tests
both logical devices during a single invocation, referring to one
as the "odd  device" (e.g., dskc_27) and the second  as the "even
device" (e.g., dskc_28).  MTR refers to both logical devices as a
single "head assembly" or "hda".

 4.  Enter MTR  test 6 to format  and test the entire  MSU0500 or
     MSU0501 device:

  ???  ox test mmt12827t6

     where "test mmt12827t6" is a sample of the input format
     "test mmtICCDDtT":

        mmt     identifies the MTR test package

        ICC     gives the IOM number (0 =  IOM A, 1 = IOM B, etc)
                and  channel number  (in decimal)  of achannel by
                which   the  device   to  be   formatted  can  be
                addressed.It  must be one  of those shown  in the
                output of  "test pcd" in  step 3.  In  the sample
                input above, "128" is IOM B, channel 28.

        DD      gives  the  device  number  (in  decimal)  of the
                device to be tested.  In  the sample input, it is
                device  27  (dskc_27).   Always  give  the device
                number  of the  "odd device"  associated with the
                disk drive.

        T       gives the number  of the MTR test to  be run.  In
                this  case, test 6  should be run  to format/test
                the drive.

 5.  The following output describes steps  taken by MTR test 6 to
     attach the disk drive for writing:

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
