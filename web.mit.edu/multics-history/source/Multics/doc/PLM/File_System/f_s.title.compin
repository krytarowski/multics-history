This System Designers' Notebook describes certain internal modules
constituting the Multics System.  It is intended as a reference for only those
who are thoroughly familiar with the implementation details of the Multics
operating system; interfaces described herein should not be used by
application programmers or subsystem writers; such programmers and writers are
concerned with the external interfaces only.  The external interfaces are
described in C__o_m_m_a_n_d_s _a_n_d A__c_t_i_v_e F__u_n_c_t_i_o_n_s
(Order No.  AG92) and S__u_b_r_o_u_t_i_n_e_s (Order No.  AG93).

As Multics evolves, Honeywell will add, delete, and modify module descriptions
in subsequent SDN updates.  Honeywell does not ensure that the internal
functions and internal module interfaces will remain compatible with previous
versions.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
