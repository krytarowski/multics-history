3/30/84  check_file_system_damage_


Function: checks a single entry for connection failures and damaged switches.


Syntax:
declare check_file_system_damage_ entry (char(*), char(*), fixed bin(35))
        returns (bit(36) aligned);
damage = check_file_system_damage_ (dir_name, entryname, code);


Arguments:
dir_name
   is the pathname of the containing directory.  (Input)
entryname
   is the entryname of the segment.  (Input)
code
   is a storage system status code.  (Output)
damage
   is a bit string.  Bit 0 is set on if any of the other
   bits are set, and indicates that there is apparently some
   damage to the entry.  Bit 1 is set if the entry damaged
   switch is on.  Bit 2 is set on if there is a connection
   failure for the entry.  Bits 3 to 35 are always returned
   off.  If code is non-zero, all bits are returned off.


Note:
damage may also be declared as

   dcl 1 damage unaligned,
         2 any bit (1),
         2 damaged_switch bit (1),
         2 connection_failure bit (1),
         2 unused bit (33);

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
