07/22/86  set_time_default, std


Syntax as a command:  std key value {-control_arg}


Syntax as an active function:  [std key value {-control_arg}]


Function:  sets a default date/time value for the process.  As an
active function, it returns "true" if the action requested was
successful, "false" otherwise.


Arguments:
key
   is a keyword representing the default to set.
value
   is a value to become the new default.  If the value is "-system"
   ("-sys"), the system default is used; if it is -pop, the command
   uses a remembered value, saved by an earlier setting with -push.  It
   is an error if you haven't done an earlier -push.


Control arguments:
-push
   saves the current value of the default before setting to the new
   value.


List of keys:
date
   sets the process default date.  The value must be acceptable to
   date_time_$format (see "Notes").
date_time
   sets the process default date_time.  The value must be acceptable to
   date_time_$format (see "Notes").
debug, db
   sets the process date/time debugging switch.  The value may be "on"
   or "true", or "off" or "false".  When debugging is enabled,
   convert_date_to_binary_ displays a description of time strings as
   they are parsed, and identifies the exact location of any error in
   the time string.  The system default value is off.


language, lang
   sets the process default language.  The language name can be in any
   of the languages known to the date/time system.  To print a list of
   acceptable language values, type "display_time_info -language".
time
   sets the process default date.  The value must be acceptable to
   date_time_$format (see "Notes").
zone
   sets the process default zone.  The zone abbreviation can be in any
   of the languages known to the date/time system.  To print a list of
   acceptable zone values, type "display_time_info -zone" or
   "display_time_info -map".


Notes:  The named format strings acceptable to date_time_$format are
described in Section 1, under "Time Format."  The names "date",
"date_time", and "time" are not allowed in this context.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
