09/05/87  rename, rn

Syntax as a command:  rn path1 name1 {...pathN nameN} {-control_args}


Function:  replaces a specified segment, multisegment file (MSF), data
management (DM) file, directory, link, or extended entry name by a
specified new name, without affecting any other names the entry might
have.


Arguments:
paths
   is the pathname of a segment, MSF, DM file, directory, link, or
   extended entry.  This argument can be "-name STR" to specify a
   nonstandard name, such as one beginning with a minus sign or
   containing * or <.  You can use the star convention, but it does not
   apply to STR.
names
   specifies the new name that replaces the storage system entryname
   portion of paths.  This argument can be "-name STR".  You can use
   the equal convention, but it does not apply to STR.


Control arguments:
-interpret_as_extended_entry, -inaee
   interpret the selected entry as an extended entry type.
-interpret_as_standard_entry, -inase
   interpret the selected entry as a standard entry type.


Access required:  You require modify permission on the containing
directory.


Notes:  Since two entries in a directory cannot have the same
entryname, rename takes special action if names already exists.  If the
entry having the entryname names has an alternate name, entryname names
is removed and you are informed of this action; renaming then occurs.
If the entry having the entryname names has only one name, the entry
must be deleted to remove the name.  You are asked whether you want the
deletion; if you answer "no," renaming does not happen.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
