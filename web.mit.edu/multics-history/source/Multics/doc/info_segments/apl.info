Syntax:  apl {workspace_id} {-control_args}


Function: invokes the APL interpreter, optionally loading a saved
workspace.


Arguments:
workspace_id
   is the pathname of a saved workspace to be loaded.  The default is
   to load your continue workspace, if any; otherwise a clear workspace
   is loaded.


Control arguments:
-brief_errors, -bfe
   prints short error messages.  (Default)
-check, -ck
   raises a compatibility error if a monadic transpose of rank greater
   than 2 or a residue or encode with a negative-left argument is
   encountered.  (The definition of these cases in  Version 2 APL is
   different from Version 1.)
-long_errors, -lge
   prints long error messages.  The short form of the message is
   printed, followed by a detailed explanation of the error.
-temp_dir path, -td path
   changes the directory that used to hold the temporary segments that
   contain the active workspace to path. The default is to use the
   process directory.


-terminal_type STR, -ttp STR
   specifies the kind of terminal being used.  Possible values of STR
   are 1050, 2741, CORR2741, ARDS, TN300, TEK4013, TEK4015, 1030,
   TYPEPAIRED, BITPAIRED, ASCII, TELERAY11, LA36.    This control
   argument specifies which one of several character translation tables
   is to be used by APL when reading or writing to the terminal.  Since
   there are different kinds of APL terminals, each incompatible with
   the rest, it is important that the correct table be used.
-user_number N
   sets the APL user number (returned by some APL functions) to N.  The
   default is 100.


Control arguments for debugging:
-debug, -db
   calls the listener (cu_$cl) upon system errors.  This puts you at a
   new command level.  The default is to remain in APL.  This control
   argument is intended for debuggin apl itself.
-meter
   saves metering information about the APL storage manager.  These
   meters may be displayed with apl_storage_meters.  The default is not
   to save any information.
-no_quit_handler, -nqh
   ignores the quit condition.  The default is to trap all quits within
   apl.


Compatibility with Version 1 APL:  Version 1 APL workspaces can be
manipulated with the )V1COPY, )V1PCOPY, )V1LIB, and )V1DROP system
commands.  There are a number of differences between the two
implementations (see apl_vs_v1apl.info).

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
