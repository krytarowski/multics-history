03/06/80  apl_get_list_nums_ external function

Function: reads and converts a segment containing PL/I or FORTRAN numbers
(in character form) into an APL vector.


Usage:
   )MFN GET_LIST_NUMS APL_GET_LIST_NUMS_
   RESULT -< GET_LIST_NUMS 'PATH'


Arguments:
PATH
   is the pathname of the text segment to be read. It can be relative or
   absolute.

RESULT
   is the numeric vector that is returned by the function. The length of
   the vector is the number of values that were read.


Notes:
The data in the segment must be in a form suitable for reading by PL/I list
directed input. The segment (or multisegment file) is opened for stream input
and read using list directed input until all of the data has been read.
A message is printed give the (1 origin) index of any values that cannot be
converted, along with the bad value itself. A zero is substituted in the result
vector for these bad values.

PL/I list directed input permits any white space character (blank, tab, new
line, new page) to be used as a delimiter between values. Also, a comma may
be used to separate values. Two adjacent commas cause a zero to be returned.
Any of the forms of PL/I (or FORTRAN) constants may be used; the value may be
signed, may have a decimal point, may have a (signed) exponent, and may be
binary or decimal, fixed or float. Only the real part of any complex values
is used. Since blanks are a delimiter, no blanks may appear within a single
value.

This function can print non-APL error messages; therefore it is advisable to
run in )ERRS LONG mode.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
