03/01/84 dump_partition

Syntax as a command:
   dump_partition pvname partname offset {length} {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:
   [dump_partition pvname partname offset {length}]


Function: displays data from a named disk partition.  By default this
data appears in octal, four words per line, although other output
formats can also be selected.  The active function returns the
contents of the specified words in octal separated by spaces.


Arguments:
pvname
   is the name of the physical volume on which the partition to be
   dumped exists.
partname
   is the name of the partition to be dumped.  It must be four
   characters or less in length.
offset
   is the offset at which to begin dumping.
length
   is the number of words to be dumped.  If not supplied, one word is
   dumped.


Control arguments:
-short, -sh
   outputs data in short form, similar to dump_segment -short.
-long, -lg
   outputs data in long form, similar to dump_segment -long.
-character, -ch
   outputs data including the ASCII character representation.
-bcd
   outputs data including the BCD character representation.
-no_header, -nhe
   prints no header.
-header, -he
   prints a header.  (Default)

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
