12/08/88  copy_seg_

Syntax:
dcl copy_seg_ external entry(char(*),char(*),char(*),char(*),
	    char(*),bit(1) aligned,fixed bin(35));
call copy_seg_(dir1, en1, dir2, en2, caller, errsw, code);


Function: This subroutine produces a copy of a Multics non-directory
branch.  Name duplication is handled by nd_handler_.


Arguments:
dir1
   the directory in which the original segment is found. (Input)
en1
   a name on the original segment. (Input)
dir2
   the directory in which the copy is to be created. (Input)
en2
   the name to be given the new segment. (Input)


caller
   the name of the calling procedure; it is used in calls to
   nd_handler_. (Input)
errsw
   indicates which segment the error reported via "code"
   occurred in; it is "0"b if the error was on the original
   segment and "1"b if on the target segment. (Output)
code
   a standard file system status code. (Output)


Notes: Any attempt to copy a segment into itself is refused and the
code error_table_$sameseg is returned to the caller.  If a name
duplication occurs and the conflicting name is not deleted, then the
code error_table_$namedup is returned to the caller.

If copying a non-empty mailbox requires that the max_length
characteristic of the source be applied to the target, then the target
max_length value will take on the default value that was given it when
created.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
