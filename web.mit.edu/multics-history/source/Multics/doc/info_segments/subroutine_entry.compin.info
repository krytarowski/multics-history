10/18/81	subroutine_entry.compin


Syntax:  .ifi subroutine_entry "declaration" "call example"
     or  .ifi subr_entry "declaration" "call example"


Function:
This macro places a subroutine entry declaration and call syntax
description on the page.


Macro action:
1) formats "declaration" and "call example" in 10pt Helvetica (also see
   Notes) at the current indentation level, with the first line of each
   hanging by one level.


Notes:
1) "declaration" and "call example" must be given as quoted strings.
2) "declaration" and "call example" may contain both literal fields and
   variable fields.	 These fields are distinguished in the output by
   presenting the variable fields in 10pt Helvetica Bold Italic instead
   of Roman.  Variable fields are denoted by enclosing them between
   tilde (~) characters.


   Example:

   .ifi subroutine_entry "declare hyphenate_word_ entry (char (**),
   .+   fixed bin, fixed bin, fixed bin (35));" "call hyphenate_word_
   .+   (~string~, ~space~, ~break~, ~code~);"

   will show "string", "space", "break", and "code" in Bold Italic with
   eveything else in Roman.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
