:Entry: list_dir_info_: 02/07/84  list_dir_info_

Function: is used by the list_dir_info, rebuild_dir, and comp_dir_info
commands to list the values in a single entry in a directory
information segment created by the save_dir_info command.


Syntax:
declare list_dir_info_ entry (ptr, fixed bin, char(1));
call list_dir_info_ (ptr, mode, prefix);


Arguments:
ptr
   points to an entry in the dir_info segment (created by invoking the
   save_dir_info command).  (Input)
mode
   is the verbosity desired.  (Input).  It can be 0, 1, or 2 (where 0
   is the least verbose).
prefix
   is a one-character prefix for every line printed.  (Input)

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
