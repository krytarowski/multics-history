Description

14  phx19395
io_error_summary is not reporting the tape-data-bit-in-error counts
properly when the -tdbie argument is selected.

13  phx18710
The command line:
   ! monitor_cache
 can cause unpredictible faults because of an uninitialized variable.  To fix
 change line 171 from:
     amonitor_interval = DEFAULT_INTERVAL * 60000000;
     to:
     amonitor_interval, factor_dividend = DEFAULT_INTERVAL * 60000000;

8  phx14813
After an "Unrecoverable Error" has occurred and the user continues, the
sector addresses are not getting properly incremented for the RANGE and
SEQUENTIAL modes.

7  phx14740
The control arguments -random or -sequential, if given after the range
arguments -from and -to, will cause the entire pack to be tested.  The
program should continue to use the range supplied, but change the mode
of testing from RANGE, to RANDOM or SEQUENTIAL.  Also a new argument
should be created to specify the range mode, -range.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
