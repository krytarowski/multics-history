:Entry: get_external_variable_: 02/01/83  get_external_variable_


Function: obtains the location and size of an external variable.


Syntax:
declare get_external_variable_ entry (char(*), ptr, fixed bin(19), ptr,
     fixed bin(35));
call get_external_variable_ (vname, vptr, vsize, vdesc_ptr, code);


Arguments:
vname
   is the name of the external variable.  (Input)
vptr
   is a pointer to the current allocation of the external variable.
   (Output)
vsize
   is the size (in words) of the external variable.  (Output)
vdesc_ptr
   is a pointer to a standard argument descriptor array describing the
   external variable.  If the external variable does not have
   descriptor information associated with it, a null pointer is
   returned.  (Output)

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
