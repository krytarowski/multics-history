07/22/86  print_time_defaults, ptd


Syntax as a command:  ptd {keys} {-control_arg}


Syntax as an active function:  [ptd key {-control_arg}]


Function:  displays system or process time-related defaults.


Arguments:
key
   selects which default value is to be displayed.


Control arguments:
-system, -sys
   requests that the system defaults be displayed instead of the
   process defaults.


List of keys:
date
   displays the default date format.  A date format shows the year,
   month, and day in month.
date_time
   displays the default date/time format.  This combines both date and
   time.
debug, db
   displays the default status of debugging in the date/time system.


language, lang
   displays the default language.  Any time words in output time
   strings are in this language.
time
   displays the default time format.  A time format shows the hour,
   minutes, and (optionally) seconds.
zone
   displays the default time zone name.  Unless explicitly specified,
   all input time strings are interpreted relative to this zone and all
   output time values are expressed in this zone.


Notes:  If set_time_default has pushed any values, these are also
shown.  The keys specify which defaults to print.  When called with no
keys, all time-related defaults are displayed, except for the debugging
switch which is shown only if it is on.  As an active function, it
returns the current value of one of the defaults.  The debugging switch
is returned as "true" if debugging is on, and "false" otherwise.

The values displayed are in the order date, date_time, time,
language, zone, and debug.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
