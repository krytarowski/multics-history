10/17/84  reverse_decat, rvdecat

Syntax as a command:  rvdecat STRA STRB C


Syntax as an active function:  [rvdecat STRA STRB C]


Function:  performs the same function as the decat command/active
function, but in reverse order.


Notes:  The active function returns the "decatenation" of STRA with
respect to the last occurrence of STRB in STRA (decat uses the first
occurrence).  The value for C is any three-digit bit string expressed
as 0 or as 1 characters such as 000,001,...,111.  The last occurrence
of STRB found in STRA divides STRA into three parts:  the part prior to
STRB, the part matching STRB, and the part following STRB.  Digits of C
correspond to these three parts.  The return string contains the parts
of STRA whose corresponding bit in C is 1.  The parts are returned in
their original order of appearance in STRA.
   [reverse_decat STRA STRB C]
is the same as--
   [reverse [decat [reverse STRA] [reverse STRB] [reverse C]]]
when STRB appears in STRA.  It is also the same as--
   [decat STRA STRB C]
when STRB does not appear in STRA.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
