01/31/84  display_fnp_idle

Syntax:  display_fnp_idle {fnp_names} {-control-args}


Function:  displays information on FNP idle time stored by
the meter_fnp_idle command.  The display can be in the form of a
summary or a line graph (histogram).


Arguments:
fnp_names
   are the names of the FNPs for which idle time information is to be
   displayed.  If fnp_names is not specified, the display covers all
   FNPs for which information has been stored.


Control arguments:
-directory path, -dr path
   specifies that information is to be taken from segments in the
   directory with pathname path (see the meter_fnp_idle command
   description for idle time segment specifications).  The default is
   to display information from idle time segments in the working
   directory.
-from DT, -fm DT
   specifies that the display is to cover a period beginning no earlier
   than the date/time DT, which must be in a form suitable for input to
   the convert_date_to_binary_ subroutine.  The default is to start the
   display from the most recent idle time segment.


-histogram, -hist
   causes output in the form of a histogram, where a line shows the
   busy percentage for each FNP at a given time interval.  The
   -histogram and -summary control arguments are mutually exclusive,
   but one or the other must be specified.
-interval N
   specifies that each line in the histogram represents an N minute
   interval.  This control argument is ignored if -summary is
   specified.  The default is 15 minute intervals.
-line_length N, -ll N
   specifies the line length of the histogram as N columns (N cannot be
   less than 38).  This control argument is ignored if -summary is
   specified.  The default is the user's terminal line length (or 80 if
   output is directed to a file).


-summary, -sum
   requests a summary display of FNP idle information for the specified
   time period.  The -summary and -histogram control arguments are
   mutually exclusive, but one or the other must be specified.
-to DT
   specifies that the display is to cover a period ending no later than
   the date/time DT, which must be in a form suitable for input to the
   convert_date_to_binary_ subroutine.  The default is to end the
   display with the latest available information.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
