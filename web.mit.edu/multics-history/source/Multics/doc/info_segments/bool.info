Syntax:  bool B1 B2 B3


Syntax as active function:  [bool B1 B2 B3]


Function:  performs bit string operations on character string
representations of bit strings.


Arguments:
B1, B2, and B3
   are bit strings entered as 0 and 1 characters.

   B3 must be four bits long.  It causes the following logical
   operations to be performed on B1 and B2.

   B3        Name                Result
   --        ----                ------
   0000      clear               all zeroes
   0001      and                 B1 & B2
   0010                          B1 &^B2
   0011      move B1             B1
   0100                          ^B1 & B2
   0101      move B2             B2


   0110      xor                 (B1&^B2) | (^B1&B2)
   0111      or                  B1 | B2
   1000      ^or                 ^(B1|B2) = (^B1&^B2)
   1001      ^xor                ^((B1&^B2) | (^B1&B2)) = (^B1|B2) &
			     (B1|^B2)
   1010      invert B2           ^B2
   1011                          ^(^B1&B2) = (B1|^B2)
   1100      invert B1           ^B1
   1101                          ^(B1&^B2) = (^B1|B2)
   1110      ^and                ^(B1&B2) = (^B1|^B2)
   1111      ^clear              all ones


Notes:  The shorter of the two strings is extended at the right with
zeroes to equal the length of the longer string.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
