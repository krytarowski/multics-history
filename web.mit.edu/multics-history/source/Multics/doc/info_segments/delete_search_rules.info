02/07/84  delete_search_rules, dsr

Syntax:  dsr paths


Function: deletes search rules for object segments.


Arguments:
paths
   are usually directory pathnames (relative or absolute) to be deleted
   from the current search rules.  One of the paths can be the keyword
   working_dir.


Notes: Site-defined keywords and home_dir and process_dir are not
accepted by delete_search_rules although they are accepted by
add_search_rules.  Deletion of the initiated_segments and
referencing_dir keywords is discouraged and may lead to unpredictable
results.

See the add_search_rules, print_search_rules, and set_search_rules
info segments.  The standard search rules are described in Section 4
under "Search Rules" in the Programmer's Reference Manual (AG91).

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
