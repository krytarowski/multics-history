Function: This entry point must be called to allow use of an I/O
switch via cross-ring attachments from an outer ring.  The call must
be made in the inner ring before the outer ring attempts to attach.


Syntax:
declare cross_ring_io_$allow_cross entry (char(*), fixed bin,
     fixed bin(35));
call cross_ring_io_$allow_cross (switch_name, ring, code);


Arguments:
switch_name
   is the inner ring switch name.  (Input)
ring
   is the highest validation level from which switch_name may be used.
   (Input)
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output)


Notes:  This entry may be called more than once with the same

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
