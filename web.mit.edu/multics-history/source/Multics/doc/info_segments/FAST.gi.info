08/18/76 FAST Subsystem

FAST is a new subsystem that provides a simple-to-use interface for
creating and running BASIC and FORTRAN programs.


Summary:
The FAST subsystem features an integrated command processor and
line-numbered text editor and it contains the new FORTRAN compiler.
FAST is recommended for introducing people to computing and also for
regular users whose needs do not go beyond FORTRAN, BASIC, and/or text
editing facilities using the Multics edm editor.

The  interface is based on a current line-numbered text buffer that may
contain a FORTRAN or BASIC program.  Typing a line beginning with a
line number modifies the text buffer.  A line without a line number is
interpreted as a command.  There are 38 commands; seven are intended
for the beginning user:  login, logout, new (create a new program), old
(use an old program), run, save (save the current text buffer), and
print_text.  Note that explicit compilation of a program is not
required.


Manuals:
The FAST Subsystem is described in "Multics FAST Subsystem Users'
Guide" (Order No. AU25) and the new FORTRAN compiler is described
in "Multics FORTRAN Reference Manual" (Order No. AT58).


Using:
To try the FAST Subsystem, log in under the FAST process overseer:
     l Personid  -po >unb>fst_process_overseer_

In order to set up a Multics FAST user, the project administrator
should set these attributes in the Project Master File (PMF) for each
user who is to use the Multics FAST Subsystem:

  initproc:         fst_process_overseer_;
  attributes:       ^vinitproc,^vdim;

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
