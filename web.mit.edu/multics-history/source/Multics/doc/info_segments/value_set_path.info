10/17/84  value_set_path, vsp

Syntax as a command:  vsp {path} {-control_arg}


Function: sets the default value segment used by the value commands
without -pathname.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a value segment or a nonexistent segment, which
   is created.  The value suffix is assumed.  If you don't give path or
   is equal to the null string (""), it is restored to your default
   value segment.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the warning printed when you lack write access to the
   value segment.


Access required: You need at least r access to the value segment, and
rw is preferred.  If you lack r access, the default path is not changed
and an error message is printed; if you lack rw, the default path is
changed, but a warning is printed.  You can use -brief to suppress this
warning.


Notes:  The default value segment in a process is initially
   [home_dir]>[user name].value
See value_defined, value_delete, value_get, value_list, value_path, and
value_set.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
