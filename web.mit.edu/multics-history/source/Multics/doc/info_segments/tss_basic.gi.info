Before running a program it must first be extracted from
tss_basic_.s.archive.  For example, entering:

   ac x >ldd>unbundled>source>tss_basic_.s.archive 4sqrs.basic

puts a copy of the 4sqrs program in your current working directory.  To
run the program, enter:

   basic_system 4sqrs.basic
   run


The following list provides a brief description of the tss_basic
programs.

   4sqrs     Writes integers as the sum of the squares of four
             integers.
   annuit    Performs the calculations necessary for determining both
             payment and withdrawal annuities.
   bayes     Analyzes the difference between the arithmetric means of
             two sets of data whose variance may not be equal.
   biconf    Determines the confidence limits for a population
             proportion based on the exact binomial distribution.
   blkjak    A simulated card game of Las Vegas-type blackjack.


   condif    Computes confidence limits for the difference between two
             population means, based on data supplied for two samples,
             one from each population.
   conlim    Computes confidence limits for an unknown population mean,
             based on random sample data.
   curfit    Determines which of six curves best fits the supplied
             data.
   linpro    Maximizes objective functions using the 2-phase method.
             It automatically supplies slack, surplus, and artificial
             variables as required for the solution.
   linreg    Produces an equation that best fits input points described
             by X and Y coordinates.  This fit is made in the
             least-squares sense.


   pert      Performs a simple PERT network analysis.
   plotto    Plots one to six functions of X simultaneously.  All
             functions have the same upper and lower limits for the
             plot.
   return    Computes annual rates of return compounded for an
             investment; given the closing price for each year of data.
   saving    Calculates the amount of money that would accumulate after
             N years at an annual interest rate R compounded T times
             per year, when the initial amount is P and an amount D is
             added at the beginning of each subsequent year.
   stat12    Computes the correlation matrix for N series of data.
   triang    Finds the unknown features of any triangle; given one side
             and any two other parts.
   truint    Calculates the true annual interest rate on an installment
             loan.


   twoplo    Plots simultaneously, two functions of a single variable,
             X.
   unita     Provides a description of univariate data with up to 300
             observations on one variable.
   xyplot    Plots single valued functions of X, with X on the vertical
             axis.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
