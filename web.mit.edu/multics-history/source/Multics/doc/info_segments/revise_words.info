10/20/86 revise_words, rw

Syntax as a command:   rw path word1 rev1...{wordn revn} {-control_args}


Function:  replaces all occurrences of a given word within a specified
text segment or MSF with a new word called the revision.  The user can
specify more than one word to be revised.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the text segment or MSF.
wordi
   is a word in the text segment to be revised.
revi
   is the revision (i.e., the replacement for wordi).


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the display of the number of revisions for each wordi.
-from n, -fm n
   revisions are made in the text segment starting from the line number
   specified by n.  If this control argument is not specified, the text
   segment is processed starting from the first line.
-header, -he
   displays the pathname of the text segment.
-lines {n}, -li {n}
   for each revision made, the lines (and line numbers) starting n
   lines before, through n lines after the line containing the revision
   are displayed.  Thus, if n is 1, three lines are displayed.  If n is
   not specified, only the line containing the revision is displayed.
   (Default)


-long, -lg
   for each word revised, the line (and line number) where the revision
   is made is displayed.
-temp_dir path, -td path
   path holds the temporary segment if the input file is an MSF.
   (Default is the process directory.)
-to n
   revisions are made in the text segment up to and including the line
   number specified by n.  If this control argument is not specified,
   the text segment is processed to the last line.
-word STR1 STR2
   replaces the word STR1 with the revision STR2 even though STR1 may
   look like a control argument.


Notes:  The -brief control argument is mutually exclusive with the
-long and -lines control arguments.


Words are found in the text segment in the same way as described for
the create_wordlist command.  Words containing no letters can be
revised even though they are normally excluded from a wordlist.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
