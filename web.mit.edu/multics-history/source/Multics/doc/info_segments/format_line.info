02/12/85  format_line, fl

Syntax as a command:  fl control_string {args}


Syntax as an active function:  [fl control_string {args}]


Function: returns a single, quoted character string that is formatted
from an ioa_ control string and other optional arguments.


Arguments:
control_string
   is an ioa_ control string used to format the return value of the
   active function (see "Notes" below).
args
   are character strings substituted in the formatted return value
   according to the control string.


Notes: The following ioa_ control codes are allowed (see the
ioa_ subroutine).  The control string is output exactly as is except
that certain constructs beginning with a caret (^) are expanded, which
may involve argument substitution or interpretation.  Unimplemented
constructs are output as is, but avoid them to allow for future
extensions.


 CONTROL           ACCEPTABLE ARGUMENTS
 ^a   ^Na          any character string
 ^d   ^Nd          a character representation of a number, including
                   optional exponent (315.44 or .2789e+2 or 1101b)
 ^i   ^Ni          same as ^d
 ^f   ^Nf          same as ^d
 ^.Df ^N.Df        same as ^d
 ^e   ^Ne          same as ^d
 ^o   ^No          same as ^d
 ^[...^            "true", "false", or an integer character string
 ...^]             any number of any character string
 ^(...^) or
 ^N(...^)          an integer character string.
 ^s  ^Ns


In addition, you can use any of the following carriage movement
controls:
      ^N/      ^N|      ^N-
      ^Nx      ^N^      ^R
      ^B       ^t       ^Nt
      ^N.Dt    ^/       ^|
      ^-       ^x       ^^
where N is an integer count or a "v".  When you give "v", an integer
character string from the args is used for count.

If you don't give optional arguments, the value returned depends on the
ioa_ control string that you specified.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
