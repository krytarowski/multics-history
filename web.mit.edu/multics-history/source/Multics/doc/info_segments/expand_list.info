10/20/86  expand_list, els


Syntax as a command:  els path {-control_args}


Function:  creates a listin segment from a lister segment.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the lister segment.  If the entryname suffix
   lister is not specified, then it is added.  A listin segment is
   created in the working directory with the same entryname as path,
   and with the entryname suffix lister changed to listin.  Any
   existing copy of this listin segment is overwritten.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   specifies that all field names are to be placed in the listin
   segment.  The default is to suppress field names for null fields.
-line_length N, -ll N specifies that the line length of the ASCII
   listin segment is to be N characters.  If this control argument is
   not specified, then only one field is placed on each line.  A field
   is placed on a new line only if adding the field to the current line
   would exceed the specified line length.  At least one field is
   placed on each line.
-totals, -tt
   displays the number of records expanded.


Notes:  The ASCII listin segment created by this command has the
following format:

   The first two lines specify the record and field delimiter
   characters.


   Beginning on the third line are the field names.  They are separated
   by a comma and a space.  A field name is placed at the beginning of
   a new line if adding it to the current line would exceed the
   specified line length.


   Each record begins with a line containing just the record delimiter
   character.


   Unless -line_length is specified, each field is placed on a separate
   line and indented one space.


The expand_list command sets the "lister" severity indicator.  A
severity of 2 is set when the expansion is not performed or the
invocation of expand_list terminates abnormally.  A severity of 0 is
set when the expansion is successfully performed and the command
terminates normally.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
