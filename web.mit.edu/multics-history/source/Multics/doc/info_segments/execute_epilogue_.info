:Entry: execute_epilogue_: 02/08/84  execute_epilogue_

Function: is called during process or run unit termination to call the
routines in the list of epilogue handlers.  The logout and new_proc
commands are the prime callers of execute_epilogue_.  It is also
called when the run unit terminates to allow programs executing in the
run unit to clean up.  The add_epilogue_handler_ subroutine is used to
add a program to the list that execute_epilogue_ calls.


Syntax:
declare execute_epilogue_ entry (bit (1) aligned);
call execute_epilogue_ (run_only);


Arguments:
run_only
   is set to "1"b if epilogue handlers are to be invoked only for the
   run unit and not for the entire process.  (Input)

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
