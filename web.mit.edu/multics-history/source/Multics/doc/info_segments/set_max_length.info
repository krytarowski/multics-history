01/14/87  set_max_length, sml

Syntax as a command:  sml path length {-control_args}


Function:  allows the maximum length of a nondirectory segment to be
set.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the segment whose maximum length is to be set.
   If path is a link, the maximum length of the target segment of the
   link is set.  You can use the star convention.
length
   is the new maximum length expressed in words.  If this length is not
   a multiple of 1024 words, it is converted to the next higher
   multiple of 1024 words.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the warning message that the length argument has been
   converted to the next multiple of 1024 words.
-decimal, -dc
   specifies that length is a decimal number.  (Default)
-interpret_as_extended_entry, -inaee
   interpret the selected entry as an extended entry type.
-interpret_as_standard_entry, -inase
   interpret the selected entry as a standard entry type.
-octal, -oc
   specifies that length is an octal number.


Access required:  You need m permission on the directory containing the
segment.


Notes:  The maximum length is the maximum size the segment can attain.
Currently maximum length must be a multiple of 1024 words (one page).

If the new maximum length is less than the current length, you are
asked if the segment should be truncated to the maximum length.  If you
answer "yes," the truncation takes place and the maximum length of the
segment is set; if "no," no action is taken.

You can't set the maximum length of a mailbox or message segment unless
the segment is empty.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
