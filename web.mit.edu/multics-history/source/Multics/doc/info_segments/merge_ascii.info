Syntax:  ma paths {-control_args}


Function:	 merges two or more related ASCII text segments.


Arguments:
paths
   are pathnames of segments to be merged as automatically as possible.
   The equal and ::	 conventions are allowed.  Up to six segments can
   be merged, including those preceded by the -edit control_argument.


Control arguments:
-edit path
   merges the segment named path in a nonautomatic manner.	Edit mode
   is entered each time a modification is found in the specified
   segment.
-minchars N
   specifies the minimum number of characters that must be identical
   for merge_ascii to assume blocks of text in different segments are
   identical.  The default value of minchars is 25.
-minlines N
   specifies the minimum number of lines that must be identical for
   merge_ascii to assume blocks of text in different segments are
   identical.  The default value of of minlines is 2.


-old_original path, -old_orig path
   identifies path as the pathname of a segment antecedent to the most
   recent common ancestor of the texts being merged and allows the
   automatic picking up of identical changes present in all the texts
   being merged.
-original path, -orig path
   identifies path as the pathname of a segment containing the original
   version of the text.  The proper original is the most recent common
   ancestor of the texts being merged.	Overlapping changes, even if
   identical, cause edit mode to be entered.
-output_file path, -of path
   put the merged output text in the segment named path.  (no ::
   convention)


Notes:  The merge_ascii program is typically used to merge texts that
have been independently modified by several users.  If an original
version of the text is available, and if the user desires, merge_ascii
performs the merge automatically, requiring user intervention only when
overlapping modifications are detected.	 When user intervention is
required, merge_ascii displays line-numbered blocks of text and then
enters edit mode allowing the user to choose lines from any text or
insert new lines.


When blocks of text are displayed, each line is preceded by a text
identifier and a line number.	 The text identifier A is reserved for
the original, whether supplied or not.	The identifiers B-G are
assigned to the texts being merged in the order in which their
pathnames are encountered on the command line.  The identifier M is
used for the merged output, if printed while in edit mode.


The equal convention is allowed; equal processing is based on the first
path argument in the command invocation.

Either the -original or -old_original (but not both) control argument
may be used to enable automatic merging.  If neither is supplied, edit
mode is entered each time differences are found in the segments being
merged.  The -old_original control argument should be used judiciously,
only if appropriate, and the user fully understands the relationships
between the texts being merged.


List of edit requests:  In the syntax of the edit requests, <text_id>
   is the lowercase letter corresponding to the text identifier used by
   merge_ascii; <line_no> is a line number in the text segment.  Line
   numbers can be specified as "<" to address the first line or as ">"
   to specify the last line of a current block.
<text_id>k
   copy current block from specified text (e.g., bk copies current
   block from text B).
<text_id><line_no>k
   copy specified line from specified text (e.g., b5k copies line 5
   from text B).
<text_id><line_no>,<line_no>k
   copy specified lines from specified text (e.g., b4,7k copies lines 4
   through 7 from text B).


<text_id>p
   print current block from specified text (e.g., bp prints current
   block from text B).
<text_id><line_no>p
   print specified line from specified text (e.g., b6p prints line 6
   from text B).
<text_id><line_no>,<line_no>p
   print specified line from specified text (e.g., b12,16p prints lines
   12 through 16 from text B).
<text_id>d
   delete the current block in specified text (e.g., md deletes the
   current block in text M).
input
   enter input mode.
.
   return from input mode to edit mode.


go
   exit editor and continue comparison.
quit
   abort merge and return to command level.  If this request is given
   during a merging procedure, all work is lost.	Work is not saved
   unless merging is done from the beginning to the end of the
   segments.
e
   execute rest of line as a Multics command line.
x
   display identifiers, current line numbers, and pathnames of each
   text.
help
   print a list of the edit requests and a brief explanation of each
   one.


Notes on edit requests:  In any invocation of edit mode the current
   block in each text is just the block of lines previously displayed.
   The current block in text M is initially empty, and is grown as the
   user selects or inputs lines.

   The print (p) and copy (k) requests may address any lines in any
   text (A to M) known to merge_ascii.	The delete (d) request can only
   be applied to the current block in text M, and has the effect of
   undoing all edit requests made since changes were last displayed.

   Multiple edit requests, delimited by blanks, can be given on a
   single request line.  However, the quit, go, input, and e requests
   must not be followed by other requests.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
