02/05/86  256K Segments

Until recently the maximum length of a Multics segment was 255K
(261120) words even though the computer hardware allows segments to be
as long as 256K (262144) words.  To support very large arrays in the
FORTRAN programming language the maximum segment length has been
increased to 256K words; however, most Multics software and user
programs are not designed to cope with such segments.

A per-process switch controls whether the process is allowed to use
segments with a maximum length of 256K words.  The default value for
this switch is set by your site, and typically it will be off.  You
can alter the switch.  See process_switch_on, process_switch_off, and
hcs_$set_256K_switch for more information.

To create a 256K-word segment, call the hcs_$set_max_length
subroutine; the set_max_length command does not support lengths above
255K words.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
