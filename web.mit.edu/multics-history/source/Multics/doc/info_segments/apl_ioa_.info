03/06/80  apl_ioa_ external function

Function:  permits an APL program to do output or formatting using the
ioa_ subroutine.


Usage:
   )DFN IOA APL_IOA_
   )DFN IOA_NNL APL_IOA_$NNL
   )DFN IOA_RS APL_IOA_$RS
   )DFN IOA_RSNNL APL_IOA_$RSNNL
   CONTROL_STRING IOA LIST
   CONTROL_STRING IOA_NNL LIST
   RESULT -< CONTROL_STRING IOA_RS LIST
   RESULT -< CONTROL_STRING IOA_RSNNL LIST


Arguments:
CONTROL_STRING
   is a character scalar or vector that specifies the ioa_ control string.
   Either the circumflex ("136) or APL overbar (^) character may be used
   as the ioa_ control character.

LIST
   is either a single APL value (or expression), or a list of APL values.
   A list of values has the form (VAL1;VAL2;VAL3...), where each value is
   separated from the next by a semicolon, and the entire list is surrounded
   by parentheses.


Notes:
All character arguments are raveled into PL/I character strings, no
matter what the original APL shape.  All numeric arguments are raveled into
a PL/I array of one dimension, no matter what the original APL shape.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
