02/20/84  compute_bill

Syntax:  compute_bill sat_path pdt_dir


Function:  is used by biller.ec to generate billing information as part
of the monthly billing process.  It totals the usage figures in the
PDTs, the miscfile, and the projfile segments, and places the totals in
the reqfile entry for each project.  It is also used by crank.ec as
part of the daily accounting job to update these same segments.


Arguments:
sat_path
   is the pathname of the SAT.
pdt_dir
   is the pathname of the directory containing the PDTs.  Generally
   this directory contains the copies of the PDTs that were copied from
   the live PDTs during an earlier part of the daily accounting job.


Entry point:
   compute_bill$update_pdts_from_reqfile
   This entry is used by the daily accounting job to  write the latest
   per-project information from the reqfile, projfile and SAT
   into the live PDTs.


Arguments:
sat_path
   is the pathname of the SAT.
pdt_dir
   generally this is the directory containing the live PDTs.  The
   pathname is >system_control.


Notes:  The reqfile, projfile, and miscfile segments are assumed to be
present in the working directory, and are implicit inputs to
compute_bill.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
