:Info: display_process_audit_flags: 03/13/86  display_process_audit_flags

Syntax:  display_process_audit_flags {-control_arg}


Function: Displays the current state of the process security audit
control flags.


Control arguments:
-long, -lg
   specifies that a long format is to be displayed.
-brief, -bf
   specifies that the short format is to be displayed (Default).


Access required:
The user of this command must have "re" access to access_audit_gate_.


Notes:
For a description of the process audit flags please refer to the
writeup on the "new_user" command in the "System Maintenance and
Operation Commands" manual (order no.  GB64) and the section "Security
Auditing" in the "System Administration Procedures" (order no.  AK50).

See also the set_process_audit_flags and edit_process_audit_flags
commands.


Examples:

   ! display_process_audit_flags
     fsobj=N/N,fsattr=MA/MA,rcp=R/R,admin=R/R,special=R/R, ...
          ... other=MA/R,admin_op,priv_op,fault,small_cc,moderate_cc

:Info: set_process_audit_flags: edit_process_audit_flags: 03/13/86  set_process_audit_flags, edit_process_audit_flags

Syntax:  set_process_audit_flags {flags_str}
         edit_process_audit_flags {flags_str}


Function: Sets the process security audit flags to the supplied value.
The set_process_audit_flags command will turn on the specified flags,
and turn off all others.  The edit_process_audit_flags command will
affect (turn on or off) only those flags given in the flags_str.


Arguments:
flags_str
   is an audit flags string acceptable to convert_access_audit_flags_.
   If this argument is omitted, the command enters a prompt loop in
   which the user is asked for an audit flags string.  A "." entered
   alone on a line will cause the loop to exit.


Access required:
The user must have "re" access on system_privilege_ and
access_audit_gate_.  The user must also have "r" access to
>udd>SysAdmin>admin>sys_admin_data if the "default" keyword is used.


Notes:
For a description of the process audit flags please refer to the
writeup on the "new_user" command in the "System Maintenance and
Operation Commands" manual (order no.  GB64) and the section "Security
Auditing" in the "System Administration Procedures" (order no.  AK50).

These commands are meant for experimentation with security audit
control flags by the system security administrator.  Permanent
settings for processes should be placed in the appropriate PNT/SAT
entries with the new_user/edit_proj command.

The special keywords "none", "all", and "default" are also recognized
for the audit flags string.  They specify:

   "none"    - all audit flags turned off,
   "all"     - all audit flags turned on,
   "default" - audit flags set to default found in sys_admin_data.

See also the display_process_audit_flags command.

! set_process_audit_flags default

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
