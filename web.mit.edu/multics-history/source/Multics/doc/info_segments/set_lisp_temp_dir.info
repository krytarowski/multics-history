04/15/88  set_lisp_temp_dir

Syntax:  set_lisp_temp_dir {path_spec}


Function: specifies the directory to use for temporary segments
created in a lisp environment. A directory other than the process
dir may be specified.


Arguments:
path_spec
   specifies the directory in which to place the
   temporary segs. This argument is optional and if not given the
   process directory will be used. If given, the path_spec takes
   one of the following forms:

   path
      specifies the absolute or relative pathname of an existing
      directory.
   -working_dir, -wd
      specifies the current working dir for the temp seg storage.
   -process_dir, -pd
      specifies the process dir (default).


Notes:
Any lisp environment, such as emacs, will be affected by this
command.  Any new lisp temp segs will be placed in the specified
directory.  Existing temp segs will not be moved to the new
directory.  Temp segs placed in a directory other than the process
dir will be preserved across processes and system interruptions.
While this is useful for debugging and for holding large temp segs,
care should be taken to delete obsolete segs as each process will
create new copies.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
