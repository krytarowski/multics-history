Syntax:  select test_string {args}


Syntax as active function:  [select test_string {args}]


Function:  tests a set of arguments and returns those arguments that
pass the test.  The test is given as the first argument and is used to
select the second-through-last arguments.  A string consisting of the
concatenation of all the arguments that pass the test, separated by
spaces, is returned.  Each argument is requoted.


Arguments:
test_string
   is the test to apply to each argument.  See "Notes" below.
args
   are the arguments to be tested.  Any number of arguments, including
   zero, can be supplied.


Notes:  Each argument is requoted, and the following active string is
constructed:

     [test_string argi]

The active string is evaluated.  The result must be either "true" or
"false."  If the result is "true," argi is selected and the requoted
argument appears in the result string.  If the result is "false," the
argument is not selected.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
