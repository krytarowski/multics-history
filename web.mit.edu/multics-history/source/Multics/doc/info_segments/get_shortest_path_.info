03/08/85  get_shortest_path_


Shortens the specified pathname by replacing each directory level with
the shortest name on the directory.  If the caller does not have access
to get the names of a directory, the original name of that directory is
left intact.

:Entry:  get_shortest_path_:  03/08/85  get_shortest_path_


Function:
Shortens the specified pathname by replacing each directory level with
the shortest name on the directory.


Syntax:
dcl get_shortest_path_ entry (char (*)) returns (char (168));
short_path = get_shortest_path_ (original_path);


Arguments:
original_path
   is the pathname of a storage system entry.  (Input)


Notes:  When more than one name qualify as the shortest name for a
directory, an attempt is made to select the name containing all lower
case characters.  If more than one name still qualifies, these names
are compared to the primary name of the directory.  The first name
found with the same first character as the primary name is chosen.
This comparison is case independent.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
