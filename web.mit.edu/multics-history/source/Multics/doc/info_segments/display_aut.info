Absentee User Table resides in >sc1>absentee_user_table.


Arguments:
absN
   names the absentee process whose Absentee User Table entry is to be
   displayed (e.g., abs1, abs2).  A starname may be given to identify
   several processes.


Control arguments:
-active
   displays entries in Absentee User Table for absentee processes that
   are currently running a job (this is the default).
-all, -a
   displays all table entries.
-lock
   displays entries in Absentee User Table which are locked.
-name Person_id, -nm Person_id
   displays entry or entries associated with the given Person_id.
-no_header, -nhe
   suppresses display of the heading information contained at the
   beginning of the Absentee User Table.  The default is to display the

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
