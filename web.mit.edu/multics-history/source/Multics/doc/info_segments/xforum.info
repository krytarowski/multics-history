Syntax:  xforum {-control_args}


Function:  invokes the Executive Forum facility


Control arguments:
-force, -fc
    rebuilds the meeting list using the current search paths.
-no_force, -nfc
    uses the original meeting list.  (Default)


Meeting Lists:
Executive Forum uses three types of meeting lists -- one for meetings
that the user is eligible to attend, one for meetings the user
regularly attends, and one for meetings that have changed since the
user last attended them.  The list of meetings the user is eligible to
attend is established the first time the user invokes Executive Forum
during a login session.  It is constructed from the search paths in
effect at that time.


If a meeting is added to those search paths, that is, the search paths
remain the same but the meetings in them change, the -force control
argument must be used to reconstruct the meeting list.  Otherwise, the
previously constructed meeting list is used.


If the user's search paths change, Executive Forum notices the
differences when it is invoked and asks the user whether or not the
meeting list should be reconstructed.


Notes:  To start the Executive Forum facility, type either
"executive_forum" or "xforum" when a ready message (usually of the form
"r 14:03 0.285 5") appears on the terminal screen just above the
cursor.  Users operate Executive Forum by selecting operations from
lists called menus.  All help needed to operate the system is available
within the Executive Forum facility itself.


Executive Forum has exactly the same AIM limitations as Forum.
Meetings are single-class segments.  All participants must be logged in
at the same authorization, which must be the access class of the
meeting.  Different meetings, however may be at different access
classes.  The access class of a meeting is the authorization of the
chairman at the time the meeting was created.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
