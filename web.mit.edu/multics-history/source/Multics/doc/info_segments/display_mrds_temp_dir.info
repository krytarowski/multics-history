08/14/84  display_mrds_temp_dir, dmtd

Syntax as a command:  dmtd temp_dir_indicator


Function:  This command displays the directory under which temporary
storage for a given data base opening is placed.  This storage includes
the "resultant model" that is created at open time for allowing access
to the data base, storage for temporary relations, and intermediate
results of complex searches.  The default is the process directory.


Arguments:
   where temp_dir_indicator must be one of the following:
database_index
   the opening index returned by the dsl_$open subroutine.  If this
   option is used, then the temporary directory pathname for that
   particular opening is displayed.
-current, -cur
   displays the current temporary directory pathname that is used in
   subsequent calls to open.


Notes:  To change from the default the command set_mrds_temp_dir is
used to allow for the opening of a data base with a very large
resultant model that does not fit in the process directory, for a data
base with a large number of temporary relations, or for searches
involving many tuples in several relations.  This would be the case if
a record quota overflow occurred in the process directory on a call to
open.

See dsl_$get_temp_dir for a subroutine interface.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
