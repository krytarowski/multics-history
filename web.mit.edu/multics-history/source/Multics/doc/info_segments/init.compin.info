11/30/86 init.compin, init_plm.compin, init_mpm.compin,
init_photo.compin

Syntax:  .ifi init	     {"footer_info"} {"page_header"}
      OR .ifi init_plm   {"footer_info"} {"page_header"}
      OR .ifi init_mpm   {"footer_info"} {"page_header"}
      OR .ifi init_photo {"footer_info"} {"page_header"}


Function:
These macros initialize the macro environment and establish the layout
of the output pages according to the entry used.	One of them should be
used as the first line in segments that use any of the other macros.
Most macro variables are initialized, but the action is interlocked so
that repeated calls do not destroy the values previously established
unless they depend on the entry used.


Arguments:
'footer_info' may be a manual order number or any other information
   that the user wants in the bottom right-hand corner of every page.
   If no footer_info argument is given, a null character string is
   used.	(The footer_info character string is called ORDER_NUMBER in
   the macros).  See also "Default footer information" below.
'page_header' is a page header that the user wants to appear on every
   page of the document, regardless of other headers implied by the
   given format.  Multiple lines may be specified by using the "!"
   title splitting convention.  The header created will appear centered
   and in the same font as section titles.


Macro action:
1) set up proper page size and vertical margins (see "Output pages"
   below)
2) set the left margin indentation to 0
3) turn on fill mode and justification


Output pages:
The four initializing macros generate slightly different output pages.
init	  'standard' size pages (to fit 8-1/2 x 11 paper), using the
	  compose default page definitions and vertical margins
init_plm	  'standard' size pages, using default page definitions and
	  modified vertical margins
init_mpm	  oversize pages suitable for reduction to 83% during print-
	  ing (when reduced, these pages also fit 8 1/2 x 11 paper)
	  (This is "old" MPM format.)
init_photo  'standard' size pages, formatted for phototypesetting
	  according the current Honeywell Informations Systems Publi-
	  cations Standards, Part IV.	 (If the output device is not a
	  phototypesetter, this entry produces "new" MPM format.)


Default footer information:
The 'init' macros automatically set two variables that become part of
the footer line
   .srv draft "DRAFT: MAY BE CHANGED"
   .srv draft_date "%Date%"
To change this information, put the following lines after the macro
call line
   .srv draft "XXX"
   .srv draft_date "XXX"
where XXX may be an empty string to show only white space.

Notes:
The page top margin setting for the old MPM format (oversize page)
is incorrect in that it does not give the required one inch
when the page is photoreduced for printing.  Therefore, the
setting has been changed from 4 lines to 6 lines.  This is
an incompatible change that may affect paging in Addenda for old
books done in this format but the problem may be avoided
by placing a .vmt 4 control immediately after the .ifi init_MPM
line.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
