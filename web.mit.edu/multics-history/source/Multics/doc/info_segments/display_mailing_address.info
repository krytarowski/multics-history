12/14/88  display_mailing_address, dsmla

Syntax:  dsmla {name(s)} {-control arguments}


Function:  displays the specified mail table entries with default
mailing address(es), which appear in the format used in message headers
displayed by read_mail.  In addition, if the mail table entry specifies
an ACS segment to allow other maintainers to update it, this pathname
is displayed, and also any alias names associated with the mail table
entry are displayed.


Arguments:
name(s)
   is the personid or alias of the user whose mailing address should
   be displayed, or the name or alias of a mail table entry for a forum
   or mailing list.  The command displays the mailing address for each
   one (printing a warning message for invalid ones).  If none are
   given, the default is the current user.  The star convention is
   allowed and the address information of any name(s) matching the
   starname will be displayed  (See "Notes on starnames").


Control arguments:
-name STR, -nm STR
   specifies that mail table name STR literally contains characters
   which are star name characters (eg, *, ?).


Notes on starnames:  As dsmla is insensitive to the type case of the
specified name, the matching of starnames is also performed insensitive
to type case.  If more than one mail table name are equal except for
type case and all match the given starname, then all are displayed.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
