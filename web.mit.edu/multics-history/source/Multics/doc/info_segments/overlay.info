02/18/85  overlay, ov

Syntax as a command:  ov paths {-control_args}


Function: reads several ASCII segments and writes the result of
superimposing print positions from each segment on the user_output I/O
switch output.


Arguments:
paths
   are the pathnames of input segments.  The archive convention is
   allowed.


Control arguments:
-indent N, -ind N
   indents the print positions of an input segment N columns on output.
   It only affects the path immediately preceding it.  If you don't
   give it, an indent of 0 is used.
-page_length N, -pl N
   sets the page length of the output.  If you don't supply it, a page
   length of 60 is used.


Notes: Because the overlay command uses the printer conversion
programs, control characters are removed from input files except for
newline (NL), backspace (BS), vertical tab (VT), and formfeed (FF).

If identical print positions containing the same characters are
superimposed, a boldface type results.  By following input segments
with -indent, you create output containing columns of text.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
