The name used to designate an MCS communications channel
is a character string of up to 32 characters. The name is
composed of components separated by periods, where each component
represents a level of multiplexing. the first two components identify
the physical channel on an FNP; further components (if present)
identify the subchannels of a concentrator (such as a VIP 7700 controller).


Format of physical channel name:
The physical channel name (which corresponds to the old-style
name of the from ttyXXX) has the following format:

	F.ANSS

where:
     F		is an FNP identifier (a, b, c, or d)

     A		is an adapter type (h for an HSLA channel,
		l for an LSLA channel)

     N		is the number of the particular adapter
		(0-2 for an HSLA, 0-5 for an LSLA)

     SS		is the decimal number of the subchannel on the
		specified adapter.


Examples:
	Name	Description		Old form

	a.l000	FNP a, LSLA 0, subchannel 0	tty000
	a.h108	FNP a, HSLA 1, subchannel 8	tty708
	b.h016	FNP b, HSLA 0, subchannel 16	ttyG16


Multiplexed channels:
The format of the additional components of the names
of subchannels of a concentrator or "multiplexer" depends on
the particular multiplexer; it may be a station
id, or a sequential number, etc.
For example:
	Name	Description

	b.h016.01	FNP b, HSLA 0, subchannel 16,
		concentrator subchannel 1

	b.h016.09	same physical channel, concentrator
		subchannel 9


ARPANET channels:
The names of ARPANET channels are of the form netXXX for user_telnet
channels or ftpXXX for file-transfer channels, where XXX is an arbitrary
3-digit number.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
