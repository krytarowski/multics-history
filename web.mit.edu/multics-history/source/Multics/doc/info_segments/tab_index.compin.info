Syntax:  .ifi tab_index "table-title"


Function:
This compose macro adds a 'table-title' to the list of Tables in the
Table of Contents if creation of such a list has been enabled (see
tab_on.info) without putting a centered table heading on the output
page.


Arguments:
'table-title' is the title of the table, as it is to appear in the list
   of Tables (first caps, no underlines).


Notes:
1) The tab_index macro is used to generate a list of Tables entry when,
   for any reason, the tab macro cannot be used to create the table
   heading.
2) This macro advances the table counter so care must be taken in
   referencing the table in the text.
3) See tab.info, tab_on.info, and tab_get_no.info for related
   information.


Examples:
The following lines produce a table with a left-justified table
heading.

     .ifi tab_get_no 1
     .ur Table %table% below reflects the 1975 data.
     .spb
     .ur Table %table%:  Table Data, 1975
     .ifi tab_index "Table Data, 1975"

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
