12/27/84  Multics help system

Multics provides online help through information segments (info segs)
such as this one.  Type the command "help" with the name of a topic
and the system will print the information contained in the info seg
that describes that topic.  A topic can be an individual command or
some other feature of the system.  For example, to get information
about the print command, type
   help print



Most info segs stop after printing a certain number of lines and ask
you if you want more information.  In response you can type
   yes (or y)   to print the next section of the info seg
   no (or n)    to stop printing the current info seg
   rest (or r)  to print the rest of the info seg without the questions
   top (or t)   to return to the beginning of the info seg.
After typing your request, press CARRIAGE RETURN.

If you want to know how to get more information about Multics that you
can read at the terminal, as you are doing now, type
   help help_infos

If you want to get general information about certain aspects of the
Multics system, type
   help topics


If you want to get information about Multics commands and other system
modules, type
   help modules

To get information about Multics published documentation, you can type
   help documentation

If the help command can't find an info seg for a given info name, use
the list_help command to find info segs that contain the specified
info name in their entrynames.


Notes on short names: Many of the info segs have short names as well
as the long names we've been using thus far.  You get the same
information with the short name; it's just that you have to type fewer
characters on your keyboard.  Three of the four info segs listed above
have short names.  To get the topics info seg, you could type
   help topic

To get the modules info seg, you could type
   help module

And to get the documentation info seg, you could type
   help doc

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
