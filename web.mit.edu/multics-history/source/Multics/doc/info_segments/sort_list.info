10/20/86  sort_list, sls


Syntax as a command:  sls path -control_args


Function:  sorts the records in the specified lister file.  The records
are sorted according to the fields specified in the -sort control
argument.  Fields are sorted without regard to case; that is, they are
sorted in alphabetical order, not in the ASCII order.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the lister file to be sorted.  The suffix lister
   must be the last component of the lister file name; however, if path
   does not have a suffix of lister, one is assumed.


Control arguments:
-brief_errors, -bfe
   suppresses error messages for lister files that have no records.
-sort STR, -st STR
   specifies how the records in the lister file are to be sorted.  This
   is a required argument.


Notes:  The sort_list command sets the "lister" severity indicator.  A
severity of 2 is set when the sort is not performed, for some reason
other than an empty lister file, or the invocation of sort_list
terminates abnormally.  A severity of 1 is set when the lister file has
no records.  A severity of 0 is set when the sort is completed and the
command terminates normally.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
