10/08/80	cancel_retrieval_request, crr

Syntax:  crr request_identifiers {-control_args}


Function:	 allows a user to delete a request for a volume retrieval
that is no longer needed.


Arguments:
   request_identifiers can be chosen from the following:
path
   is the full or relative pathname of the segment or subtree of the
   retrieval request to be cancelled.  The star convention is allowed.
-entry STR, -et STR
   identifies the request to be cancelled by STR, the entryname portion
   of the segment or subtree pathname.	The star convention is allowed.
-id ID
   identifies the request to be cancelled specified by its request ID
   number.  This identifier may be used to further define any path or
   -entry identifier (see "Notes").


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   indicates that all retrieval queues are to be searched starting with
   the highest priority queue and ending with the lowest priority
   queue.	 This control argument is incompatible with the -queue
   control argument.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses messages telling the user that a particular request
   identifier was not found or that requests were cancelled when using
   star names or the -all control argument.


-queue N, -q N
   specifies that retrieval queue N contains the request to be
   cancelled, where N is a decimal integer specifying the number of the
   queue.	 If this control argument is omitted, only the default
   priority queue is searched.  This control argument is incompatible
   with the -all control argument.
-user User_id
   specifies the name of the submitter of the requests to be cancelled,
   if not equal to the group identifier of the process.  The User_id
   can be Person_id.Project_id, Person_id, or .Project_id.	Both r and
   d extended access to the queue are required.  This control argument
   is primarily for operators and administrators.


Access required:  The user must have o extended access to the queue to
cancel their own requests.  The user must have r and d extended access
to cancel a request entered by another user.


Notes:  If any path or -entry STR request identifiers are given, only
one -id ID request identifier will be accepted and it must match any
requests selected by path or entryname.

Multiple -id ID identifiers can be specified in a single command
invocation only if NO path or entry request identifiers are given.


Normally, deletion can be made only by the user who originated the
request.

When star names are not used and a single request identifier matches
more than one request in the queue(s) searched, none of the requests
are cancelled.  However, a message is printed telling how many matching
requests there are.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
