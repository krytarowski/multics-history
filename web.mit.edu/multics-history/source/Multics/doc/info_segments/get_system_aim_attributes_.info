:Entry: get_system_aim_attributes_: 01/19/83  get_system_aim_attributes_


Function: returns a structure describing the AIM attributes
defined on this system.


Syntax:
declare get_system_aim_attributes_ entry (ptr, char(*), ptr, 
     fixed bin(35));
call get_system_aim_attributes_ (area_ptr, version_wanted,
     aim_attributes_ptr, code);


Arguments:
area_ptr
   is a pointer to an area in which the aim_attributes structure is
   allocated.  (Input)
version_wanted
   is the version of the structure that the caller expects
   get_system_aim_attributes_ to return.  The only supported version at
   present is given by the value of the named constant
   AIM_ATTRIBUTES_VERSION_1 defined in the system include file
   aim_attributes.incl.pl1.  (Input)
aim_attributes_ptr
   is set to locate the aim_attributes structure allocated by this
   program.  (Output)


code
   is a standard system status code.  (Output) It can be one of the
   following:
   0
      the aim_attributes structure was successfully allocated.
   error_table_$unimplemented_version
      the version of the structure requested by the caller is not
      implemented by get_system_aim_attributes_.
   error_table_$noalloc
      there was not sufficient room in the caller's area to allocate
      the aim_attributes structure.


Notes: The aim_attributes structure is defined in the system include file
aim_attributes.incl.pl1 and has the following format:

   dcl 1 aim_attributes           aligned based,
         2 version                char(8) unaligned,
         2 access_class_ceiling   bit(72),
         2 levels (0 : 7),
           3 long_name            char(32) unaligned,
           3 short_name           char(8) unaligned,
         2 categories (18),
           3 long_name            char(32) unaligned,
           3 short_name           char(8) unaligned,


Structure elements:
   version
      is the version of this structure (currently
      AIM_ATTRIBUTES_VERSION_1).
   access_class_ceiling
      is the maximum authorization or access class in terms of the AIM
      attributes.
   levels
      are the sensitivity levels defined on this system.  Only the
      entries from levels(0) through levels(highest_level) contain
      definitions.  The remaining entries are all blank.
      long_name
         is the long name of this sensitivity level.
      short_name
         is the short name of this sensitivity level.


   categories
      are the access categories defined on this system.  Only the first
      n_categories entries of this substructure contain definitions.
      The remaining entries are all blank.
      long_name
         is the long name of this sensitivity level.
      short_name
         is the short name of this sensitivity level.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
