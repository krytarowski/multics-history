Section 5:  Add the following control argument documentation to
     the command write-ups for the store (page 5-66),
     store_from_data_file (pg 5-68), write (pg 5-71), and
     write_data_file (pg 5-72) requests.

     -no_progress, -npg
        specifies that progress messages should not be printed.
        (DEFAULT)
     -progress, -pg
        specifies that a progress message should be printed after
        N tuples have been processed, where N is any positive
        integer.  If N is not specified the default is to print a
        progress message after 1000 tuples.


Section 5:  Add the following control argument documentation to
     the command write-ups for the store (pg 5-66) and
     store_from_data_file (pg 5-68) requests.

     -no_warning, -no_warn
        specifies that warning messages should not be printed
        when storing the tuple results in a conversion error or
        duplicate tuple error.
     -warning, -warn
        specifies that warning messages are printed when storing
        the tuple results in a conversion error or duplicate
        tuple error.  (DEFAULT)


Section 5:  Under the notes section for the store (pg 5-66) and
     (pg 5-68) store_from_data_file requests add the following.

     Warning messages are printed when attempting to store a new
     row into the table causes a conversion error or a duplicate
     tuple error.  When these warning messages are printed, the
     tuple is not stored.  Any other errors besides these
     previously mentioned two result in the termination of the
     request.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
