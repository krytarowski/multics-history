03/06/80  convert_tsoapl_ws, ctw

Function: converts a saved workspace of IBM APL, as read into a Multics segment
by read_tsoapl_tape, into a saved workspace usable by Multics APL.
Only global names and values are converted; the state indicator (SI) is
not converted.


Syntax:  ctw tsopath {newpath}


Arguments:
tsopath
   is the pathname of the segment to be converted. The suffix sv.tsoapl
   is assumed.

newpath
   is the pathname of the segment that the converted workspace should be
   placed into. The default is to create a segment in the working
   directory with a name constructed from the first component of the
   entryname of tsopath, and a suffix of sv.apl.


Notes:  Diagnostics are printed for numeric values that cannot be converted
from IBM hexadecimal floating-point to Multics binary floating-point.
Values that are too large are replaced by the largest value; values that
are too small are replaced by the smallest value.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
