:Entry: cv_float_: 02/01/83  cv_float_


Function: converts an ASCII representation of a floating point number
and returns a single precision floating point representation.  If an
illegal character is encountered, its index in the string is returned
and the number is set to 0.0e0.  (See also cv_float_double_.)


Syntax:
declare cv_float_ entry (char(*), fixed bin(35)) returns (float bin);
a = cv_float_ (string, code);


Arguments:
string
   is the string to be converted.  (Input)
code
   is the index in string of the first illegal character, if found;
   otherwise it is zero.
a
   is the result of the conversion.  (Output)


Notes:
Code is not a standard status code.  Therefore, it can not be passed to
com_err_ and other subroutines that accept only standard status codes.

This function can be performed more efficiently in PL/I by:

      on conversion,size goto badnumber;
      a = convert (a, string);
      revert conversion,size;
         .
         .
         .
      badnumber:
      call com_err_ (error_table_$bad_conversion, proc, string);
      return;

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
