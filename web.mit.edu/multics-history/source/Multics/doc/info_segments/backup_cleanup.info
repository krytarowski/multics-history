06/17/82  backup_cleanup, bc

Syntax:  bc {starnames} {-control_args}


Function: deletes and optionally dprints backup maps and error files.
Copies error files into >udd>SysDaemon>error_file.  This command is
useful when a backup run has been interrupted.


Arguments:
starnames
   specify the pathnames of particular maps and error files to be 
   processed.  Given the starname PATH, all segments matching PATH.map
   and PATH.ef are (dprinted and) deleted. If no starnames are 
   specified, all segments in the working directory matching *.*.map
   or *.*.*.ef are processed.


Control arguments:
-dprint, -dp
   causes maps to be dprinted to "SysDaemon/OLD MAP" and error files to
   be dprinted to "SysDaemon/OLD ERROR FILE". This is the default.
-no_dprint, -ndp
   suppresses dprints and causes the segments processed to be deleted.
-queue N, -q N
   specifies queue number N for dprints. The default is queue 1.


Notes: Control arguments to backup_cleanup, unlike control arguments
to other backup commands, affect only the command invocation and do
not set static switches that affect later backup command invocations.


Example:

   bc >udd>Carry>reload.**

causes all segments in >udd>Carry whose names match reload.**.map or
reload.**.ef to be dprinted and deleted.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
