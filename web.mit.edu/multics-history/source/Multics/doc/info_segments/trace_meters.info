09/22/83  trace_meters, tmt

Syntax:  tmt {-control_args}


Function:  formats and displays the cpu time and page fault meters of
entry points that are traced with "-meter on" (see the trace command).


Control arguments:
-global_percent N, -gpct N, -g% N
   reports only entry points whose global cpu time or global page
   faults exceed N% of the total.  N must be a whole number.
-output_file path, -of path
   causes output to be directed to the file specified by path.  The
   file is overwritten if it already exists, or created if it does not.
   The ".tmt" suffix is added to path if it is not given.
-percent N, -pct N, -% N
   reports only entry points whose local cpu time or local page faults
   exceed N% of the total.  N must be a whole number.
-report_reset, -rr
   displays the report and zeroes the meters.
-reset, -rs
   set the meters of every entry point in the trace table to zero and
   does not display the report.


Notes:  If no arguments are supplied, the report is displayed and the
meters are not reset.

Entry points that have not been called since the last reset are not
reported.

Some programs are on a special list of programs that can never be
traced (see the trace command).  Some entry points can not be traced
because they are written in alm and are added to the trace table when
"-alm off" is in effect.  The tracing of some entry points may have
been turned off by the "trace -off" command.  Entry points that are not
metered either because they can not be traced or because they have been
turned off are, nevertheless, counted and are reported with empty meter
columns.


If the local virtual cpu time reported for a procedure that has been
called only a few times is unbelievably large, consider the possibility
that it snapped some dynamic links during its run.  This metering error
can be eliminated by reseting the meters and repeating the run within
the same process.  It can be completely avoided by making a trial run
before metering.


Notes on column headings:  The column headings of the report are
interpreted as follows:

       GREAL       global real time
       GVCPU       global virtual cpu time
       GPF         global page faults
       LREAL       local real time
       LVCPU       local virtual cpu time
       LPF         local page faults
       LVCPU/CALL  local virtual cpu time per call
       LVCPU%      local vcpu time as a percentage of total vcpu time
       CALLS       number of calls

Global means the resources used by an entry point and everything it
calls.  Local means the resources used by an entry point less the
resources used by all traced entry points that it calls.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
