10/20/86  add_dict_words, adw


Syntax as a command:  adw path {words} {-control_args}


Function:  adds words to a Wordpro dictionary.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the dictionary to which the words are added.  If
   path does not have the suffix dict, one is assumed; however, dict
   must be the last component of the dictionary segment name.  If the
   dictionary does not exist, it is created.
words
   are words to add to the dictionary.  At least one word is required
   unless -input_file is specified.  If a word is already in the
   dictionary with the same hyphenation and no-trim attribute, the word
   is ignored without comment.  However, if the word is already in the
   dictionary with different hyphenation or no-trim attribute, then a
   warning is issued and the dictionary word is left unchanged unless
   -force is specified.


Control arguments:
-count, -ct
   reports the number of words added and the total number of words in
   the dictionary.
-force, -fc
   allows a word already in the dictionary to be replaced.  This
   feature may be used to change the no-trim attribute or hyphenation
   of a word in the dictionary.
-input_file path, -if path
   adds to the dictionary words contained in the segment specified by
   path.  Words in this segment must be separated by newlines.  This
   control argument may be specified more than once.
-raw
   suppresses the special interpretation otherwise given to hyphen and
   circumflex characters.


-word STR
   adds the word STR to the dictionary even though STR may look like a
   control argument.


Notes:  The correct hyphenation of a word can be specified when it is
added to the dictionary.  Embedded hyphens indicate the hyphenation
points.  If no hyphenation points are specified, it is assumed that the
word cannot be hyphenated.  If a word is spelled with a hyphen, then
that hyphen must be followed by another hyphen or an equal sign.  The
character sequence "--" indicates that the word contains a hyphen and
that hyphenation may be performed at (after) the hyphen.  The character
sequence "-=" indicates that the word contains a hyphen, but the word
may not be hyphenated at the hyphen.


If the -raw control argument is specified, no special interpretation is
given to either hyphen or circumflex characters.  Each such character
found within a word is taken literally as a part of the word.
Therefore, words added with the -raw control argument cannot have the
no-trim attribute or hyphenation points.  Maximum word size is limited
to 256 "literal characters".  Only characters contained in the normal
spelling of a word are literal characters.  Thus, the special sequences
"--" and "-=" both represent the single literal character "-".  Literal
hyphens may appear anywhere within a word.  Hyphenation points,
however, may not appear beyond the 33rd literal character of a word.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
