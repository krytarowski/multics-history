04/05/84  deactivate_seg

Syntax:  deactivate_seg path {-control_arg}


Function:  allows you to deactivate a segment or directory.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the segment or directory to be deactivated or a
   segment number.


Control arguments:
-force, -fc
   deactivates the segment or directory, if possible, by using the
   highly privileged demand_deactivate entry.


Access required:  This command requires access to the phcs_ gate; if
-force is used, it requires access to the hphcs_ gate.


Notes:  If -force is not supplied, the segment or directory is only
deactivated if all processes connected to it have the allow_deactivate
attribute set (see the change_kst_attributes command).  If -force is
specified, the segment is deactivated unless its entry hold switch is
set and the directory is deactivated unless it has active inferiors.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
