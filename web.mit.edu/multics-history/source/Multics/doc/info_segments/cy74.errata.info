pg 3-3:  under the section CURRENT TRANSACTION, add the following |
     to the end of the first paragraph:                           |
                                                                  |
     When you enter a meeting, the current transaction is         |
     initially set to the last seen transaction that has not been |
     deleted or expunged.  If there is no seen transaction in the |
     meeting, "current" will then be set to the first non_deleted |
     transaction.                                                 |


pg 3-4:  under the RELATIVE ORDER KEYWORDS section, update        |
     'current' with the following:                                |
                                                                  |
     current, c                                                   |
         refers to a transaction that was affected by list,       |
         print, write or reset.                                   |


pg 3-5:  in the section SEEN/UNSEEN TRANSACTIONS, update the      |
     keywords 'last_seen' and 'last_unseen" with the following:   |
                                                                  |
     last_seen                                                    |
         refers to the highest-numbered transaction marked as     |
         having been seen.                                        |
                                                                  |
     last_unseen                                                  |
         refers to the highest-numbered transaction not marked as |
         having been seen.                                        |


pg 7-17:  under the NOTES section of the 'delete' request, add    |
     the following:                                               |
                                                                  |
     If there are no more non_deleted transactions left after the |
     old current transaction, "current", is set to the last       |
     un-deleted transaction.                                      |     


pg 7-47:  under the '-meeting' control argument for 'reply', add  |
     the following:                                               | 


     The subject will be the subject of the transaction to which  |
     the user is replying.  As forum does not chain transactions  |
     across meetings, the transaction which is created in the     |
     meeting_name meeting will not be chained to anything even    |
     though it has a header which is of the standard "Re:         |
     <subject>" format.  If the user enters the same request      |
     multiple times, the resulting transactions will not be       |
     chained together, although they will all have the same       |
     title.  Note that if a user subsequently attends the         |
     meeting_name meeting and replys to any of the transactions   |
     posted from the first meeting, the user's reply will be      |
     chained to the transaction number in the meeting_name        |
     meeting to which he replied.                                 |


pg 8-2:  add the following control argument to the 'forum'        |
     command:                                                     |
                                                                  |
     -auto_write                                                  |
         specifes that the qedx request automatically updates the |
         message when the user quits the editor.                  |


pg 8-3:  add the following control argument to 'forum' command:   |
                                                                  |
     -no_auto_write                                               |
         specifes that the qedx request requires the user to use  |
         the 'write' request to update the message before         |
         quitting the editor.  Any attempt to exit without        |
         writing results in a query.                              |

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
