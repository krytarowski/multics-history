:Entry: translate_aim_attributes: 01/19/83  translate_aim_attributes


Function: translates the AIM attributes in an authorization or access
class from one system's defintion to another system's definition if
possible.


Syntax:
declare translate_aim_attributes entry (ptr, bit(72) aligned, ptr,
     bit(72) aligned, fixed bin(35));
call translate_aim_attributes (source_aim_attributes_ptr,
     source_authorization, target_aim_attributes_ptr,
     target_aim_authorization, code);


Arguments:
source_aim_attributes_ptr
   is a pointer to the aim_attributes structure defining the AIM
   attributes of the source system.  (Input) This structure is declared
   in aim_attributes.incl.pl1.
source_aim_authorization
   is the access class or authorization expressed to be translated to
   the equivalent value on the target system.  (Input)
target_aim_attributes_ptr
   is a pointer to the aim_attributes structure defining the AIM
   attributes of the target system.  (Input)
target_aim_authorization
   is set to the access class or authorization on the target system
   which is equivalent to the value given on the source system.
   (Output)


code
   is a standard system status code.  (Output) It can be one of the
   following:
   0
      the authorization or access class was successfully translated.
   error_table_$unimplemented_version
      one of the aim_attributes structures supplied by the caller was
      of a version not supported by this procedure.
   error_table_$ai_no_common_max
      there is no set of AIM attributes in common between the two
      systems.
   error_table_$ai_outside_common_range
      the source access class or authorization is not less than or
      equal to the common access class ceiling between the two systems.


Notes: See the description of the get_system_aim_attributes_
subroutine for a definition of the aim_attributes structure.

The translation of AIM attributes can only be performed for an
authorization or access class that is less than or equal to the common
access ceiling between the two systems.  See the Programmers' Reference
Manual for a definition of common access ceiling.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
