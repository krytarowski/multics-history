10/13/77  Differences between compose and runoff

This info file gives the differences between runoff and compose.
A "title" response is recommended, followed by a "search" for the section
of interest.  The sections are not in any particular order.


Title Delimiter:
In order to implement free format header and footer blocks (allowing artwork
and other text features), it is necessary to define a standard title part
delimiter character in a manner similar to the Symbol Delimiter.  This title
part delimiter character is chosen as the vertical bar ("|") and may be changed
by the user with the change-title-delimiter control.  Any <title> not
beginning with the current title delimiter character will be rejected with a
diagnostic message.

Symbol Delimiter:
The conventional use of the symbol delimiter (%) as a reference to the page
counter has been removed; however, the remainder of the symbol delimiter parsing
algorithm is unchanged from the algorithm used in runoff.  This means that 
constructs for nesting and/or concatenation of variable values and literal 
strings should continue to work as they did for runoff.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
