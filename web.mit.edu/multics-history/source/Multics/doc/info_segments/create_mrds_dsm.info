08/13/84  create_mrds_dsm, cmdsm

Syntax as a command:  cmdsm source_path db_path {-control_args}


Function:  This command creates a MRDS data base submodel from a data
submodel source segment.  The path of the resulting data submodel can
be specified as an argument to the dsl_$open subroutine or the
mrds_call open or LINUS open commands instead of the path to a data
base directory.  This command is intended for use by data base
administrators (DBAs) when defining a view of a data base for a given
application.  The submodel created only works against the data base
whose path was in the command and not against similar data bases with
other pathnames.


Arguments:
source_path
   is the pathname of a data submodel source segment.  If source_path
   does not have a suffix of cmdsm, then one is assumed.  However, the
   cmdsm suffix must be the last component of the name of the source
   segment.
db_path
   is the pathname of the data base with which the resulting data
   submodel is to be associated.  This data base must exist.


Control arguments:
-force, -fc
   overwrites an existing submodel with the same name without querying
   the caller to be sure that the old submodel can be destroyed.
-install, -ins
   creates the submodel in the secure.submodels directory that is under
   the data base directory rather than in the working_dir.  The use of
   this control argument causes a directory named secure.submodels to
   be created under the data base directory if it does not already
   exist.  This control argument is restricted to DBAs.
-list, -ls
   creates a segment containing a listing of the submodel source,
   followed by information about the submodel to model mapping, in the
   working directory.  The segment also contains a list of any errors
   found while creating the submodel.


-no_force, -nfc
   if a submodel with the same name already exists, queries the user as
   to whether it can be overwritten.  This control argument undoes the
   effects of a -force.  (Default)
-no_install, -nins
   creates the submodel in the working_dir.  (Default)
-no_list, -nls
   specifies that a listing segment is not created.  (Default)


Notes:  The data submodel is a multisegment file with the same name as
the submodel source but with a dsm (rather than cmdsm) suffix.

Error messages are written to the error_output I/O switch as they
occur.  These messages are also included in the listing segment if one
is produced.

Only a DBA can run this command against a secure data base.  If the
data base is secure and the -install control argument is not used, the
submodel will be created in the DBA's working directory and a warning
that the submodel is not secure will be issued.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
