Syntax:  .ifi command "command usage line"


Function:
This macro places a command usage syntax description on the page.


Macro action:
1) inserts 24pt of white space
2) emits the label "SYNTAX AS A COMMAND" in 10pt Helvetica Bold Italic
   flush left, followed by white space appropriate for the device
3) formats "command usage line" in 10pt Helvetica (also see Notes) at
   the first indentation level


Notes:
1) If "command usage line" contains white space, it must be given as a
   quoted string.
2) "command usage line" may contain both literal fields and variable
   fields.  These fields are distinguished in the output by presenting
   the variable fields in 10pt Helvetica Bold Italic instead of Roman.
   Variable fields are denoted by enclosing them between tilde (~)
   characters.  For example

      "command ~args~ {-~control_args~}"

   will present "command" in Roman and "arg" and "control_args" in Bold
   Italic.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
