Syntax: pcr path {-contol_args}


Function:  Extracts reports from a file created by a cobol program that
used the report writer feature.


Arguments:
path 
   is the pathname of the input file

Control arguments:
-report_code STR , -rcd STR
   specifies which report(s) are to be extracted from the
   report file.  STR consists of a string of report codes
   (the two character designators supplied in the code phrase
   of the cobol program) with values separated by commas with
   no spaces.  This control argument is incompatable with the
   the -all control argument.

-output_file path , -of path
   specifies that the output is to be directed to the file
   indicated by path. The default is for the output to be
   directed to user_output (terminal).

-all , -a
   specifies that all reports in the report file are to be processed.
   This control argument is incompatible with the -report_code control
   argument.

-no_newpage , -nnp
   specifies that newpage characters are not to be emitted when -output_file
   is used.  The default is for each page to end with a newpage character.

-stop , sp
   waits for a carriage return from the user before begining typing and after
   each page of output to the terminal.

Notes:
     When outputting to the terminal pcr assumes the terminal is
positioned to the top of a page.
     When neither -all nor -repot_code control arguments are specified,
then the report designated by the default code is processed.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
