:Entry: clock_:  01/28/82  clock_


Function: reads the system clock and returns a fixed binary number
equal to the number of microseconds since 0000 hours Greenwich mean
time January 1, 1901.  The returned time is suitable for input to the
date_time_ or decode_clock_value_ subroutines, which convert the clock
reading to an ASCII representation.


Syntax:
declare clock_ entry returns (fixed bin(71));
date_time = clock_ ();


Arguments:
date_time
   is the number of microseconds since January 1, 1901, 0000 hours
   Greenwich mean time.  (Output)


Notes:  The clock PL/I builtin function should be used in PL/I programs
instead of this subroutine, because it is more efficient.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
