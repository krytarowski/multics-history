03/14/85  revert_output, ro

Syntax as a command:  ro {-control_args}


Function: reverts the effect of the file_output, syn_output, and
terminal_output commands, i.e., releases the most recent preceding
command.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   reverts all file_output, syn_output, and terminal_output attachments
   for specified I/O switches or for all switches if you specify none.
-source_switch STR, -ssw STR
   specifies the name of an I/O switch to be redirected.  (Default:
   user_output)


Notes: Each command invocation of file_output, terminal_output, or
syn_output stacks up another attachment for each of the specified
switches.  The revert_output command pops and restores one attachment
from the stack; it does not revert attachments made, for example, by
the io_call command.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
