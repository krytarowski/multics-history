03/06/84	expand_cobol_source, ecs

Syntax:  ecs oldpath {newpath} {-control_args}


Function:	 transforms a COBOL source program before compilation.


Arguments:
oldpath
   is the pathname of the input segment.  The suffix ".cobol" is
   assumed.
newpath
   is the pathname of the output segment. The suffix ".cobol" is
   assumed.  If this argument is omitted, then the translated segment
   is in the form of the first component with the suffix ".ex.cobol".


Control arguments:
-card
   deletes meaningless trailing blanks from a standard fixed-format
   COBOL source program in card image format.
-expand, -exp
   translates a standard fixed-format COBOL source program that
   possibly contains COPY and REPLACE statements into an equivalent
   source program not containing these statements.  (Default)
-format, -fmt
   translates a pseudo free-form COBOL source program into a standard
   fixed-format COBOL source program.  All characters in the source
   program are left exactly as typed.


-lower_case, -lc
   translates exactly as -format except that all characters, not
   counting those in alphanumeric literals, are converted to lowercase.
-no_expand, -no_exp
   does not translate COPY and REPLACE statements in a standard
   fixed-format COBOL source program.
-upper_case, -uc
   translates exactly as -format except that all characters, not
   counting those in alphanumeric literals, are converted to uppercase.


Notes: See the Multics COBOL User's Guide (Order No. AS43) for a
description of pseudo free-form text.  See the Multics COBOL Reference
Manual's description of the COPY and REPLACE statements.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
