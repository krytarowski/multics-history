10/17/84  reverse_search, rvsrh

Syntax as a command:  rvsrh STRA STRB


Syntax as an active function:  rvsrh STRA STRB


Function:  performs the same function as the search command/active
function, but in reverse order.


Notes:  The active function returns the index (character position) of
the last character in STRA that appears in STRB (search returns the
first such character).  If no characters of STRA appear in STRB, 0 is
returned.
   [reverse_search STRA STRB]
is the same as--
   [length STRA] - [search [reverse STRA] STRB] + 1
when a character of STRB appears in STRA.  It is 0 when a character of
STRB does not appear in STRA.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
