Syntax as a command:  links star_names {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [links star_names {-control_args}]


Function:  returns the entrynames or absolute pathnames of links that
match one or more star names.


Arguments:
star_names
   is a star name to be used in selecting the names to be returned.


Control arguments:
-absolute_pathname, -absp
   returns absolute pathnames rather than entrynames.
-inhibit_error, -ihe
   ignore star_names if they are invalid or if access to tell of an 
   entry's existence is lacking.
-no_inhibit_error, -nihe
   prints an error message if given an invalid star_name or if
   access to tell of an entry's existence is lacking.  (Default)


Notes:  Only one name per link is returned; i.e., if a link has more
than one name that matches star_name, only the first match found is
returned.

Since each entryname (or pathname) returned by links is enclosed in
quotes, the command processor treats each name as a single argument
regardless of the presence of special characters in the name.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
