Syntax:  lpc pgs_name {symbol_names}


Function: prints information about the graphic symbols found within a specified
permanent graphic segment (PGS). The user can list all symbols in a given PGS,
or specify that only certain symbols are to be listed.


Arguments: 
pgs_name
   is the name of a permanent graphic segment to be inspected.
   The star convention can be used. If the suffix .pgs is not explicitly
   provided, it is assumed.
symbol_names
   (Optional) are symbol names to be listed. The star convention can be used.
   If any symbol_names arguments are supplied, only symbols matching those

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
