10/20/86 copy_list, cpls

Syntax as a command:  cpls path1 path2 {-control_args}


Function:  creates a new list segment from an existing list segment.


Arguments:
path1
   is the pathname of the existing lister file.  The suffix lister must
   be the last component of the list segment name; however, if path1
   does not have a suffix of lister, one is assumed.
path2
   is the pathname of the new list segment.  The suffix lister must be
   the last component of the list segment name; however, if path2 does
   not have a suffix of lister, one is assumed.


Control arguments:
-brief_errors, -bfe
   suppresses error message when no records are selected.
-select STR, -sel STR
   copies records specified by STR (the STR argument must be enclosed
   in quotes).  If this control argument is not specified, then all
   records are copied.
-totals, -tt
   displays the number of records copied.


Notes:  The copy_list command sets the "lister" severity indicator.  A
severity of 2 is set when the copy was not performed or the invocation
of copy_list terminated abnormally.  A severity of 1 is set when the
copy was done but no records are copied, i.e., the input file had no
records or the selection expression found no match.  A severity of 0 is
set when the copy was done and at least one record was copied.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
