:Entry: get_lock_id_: 02/02/84  get_lock_id_


Function: returns the 36-bit unique lock identifier to be used by a
process in setting locks.  By using this lock identifier, a convention
can be established so that a process wishing to lock a data base and
finding it already locked can verify that the lock is set by an
existing process.


Syntax:
declare get_lock_id_ entry (bit(36) aligned);
call get_lock_id_ (lock_id);


Arguments:
lock_id
   is the unique identifier of this process used in locking.  (Output)


Notes:  For a more detailed discussion of locking see the set_lock_
subroutine description.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
