03/06/85  forum_admin

Syntax as a command:  forum_admin key {arguments}


Function:  allows system administrators to change attributes of
meetings that they do not chair.  This command is also used to perform
certain administrative functions such as initializing the forum
notifications database.


Arguments:
key
   is any key described in "List of Keys."
arguments
   are the arguments for individual keys described below.


List of keys:
change_chairman path new_chairman
   displays the User_id of the current chairman of the meeting whose
   pathname is "path" and then shifts the chairmanship to new_chairman.
   new_chairman must be of the form Person_id.Project_id.
convert path
   converts the meeting whose pathname is "path" from a pre-MR11
   version meeting to a current version meeting.
delete path
   deletes the meeting whose pathname is "path".
init_notifications
   creates an empty notifications database segment in the central forum
   directory.


switch_off switchname, swf switchname
   turns the specified switch off.
switch_on switchname, swn switchname
   turns the specified switch on.


List of switches:
adjourned path, adj path
   temporarily adjourns the meeting specified by path.  When this
   switch is on, no users may enter the meeting.
chairman_set_eligibility_msg, cm_set_emsg
   allows the chairman to override the print_eligibility_messages
   switch.
meeting_eligibility_messages path, mtg_emsg path
   turns on eligibility messages for the meeting named by "path".
print_eligibility_messages, pemsg
   turns on eligibility messages for all meetings on the system.


Access  required:  This  command  requires  access to the forum_admin_
gate.   In  addition,  the  convert,  delete, and access-changing keys
require  at  least "m" access to the directory containing the meeting,
as  does  setting  a  switch  on  a  meeting if access must be forced.
Setting  global  switches requires "rw" access to forum_data_, and the
init_notifications  key  requires  "sma"  access  to the central forum
directory.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
