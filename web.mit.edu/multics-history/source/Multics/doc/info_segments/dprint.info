05/01/84  dprint, dp

Syntax:  dp {-control_args} {paths}


Function:  queues specified segments and/or multisegment files for
printing on one of the Multics line printers.  The output is by default
identified by your Person_id.  This command does not accept standard
object segments.

Use enter_output_request; it has functionally replaced dprint.


Arguments:
paths
   are pathnames of segments and/or multisegment files.  The star
   convention is not allowed.


Control arguments:
-access_label, -albl
   uses the access class of each pathi specified as a label at the top
   and bottom of every page (see "Notes" below).
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the message "j requests signalled, k already queued.
   (request_type queue)."  This control argument cannot be overruled
   later in the command line.  (See -request_type and -queue below.)
-bottom_label STR, -blbl STR
   uses the specified string as a label at the bottom of every page
   (see "Notes" below).


-copy N, -cp N
   prints N copies (N <= 4) of specified paths.  It can be overruled by
   a subsequent -copy.  If pathi is to be deleted after printing, all N
   copies are printed first.  If this control argument is not
   specified, one copy is made.
-defer_until_process_termination, -dupt
   does not process the request until the requesting process
   terminates.  Process termination is caused by the logout command,
   new_proc, or a fatal process error.
-delete, -dl
   deletes (after printing) specified paths.


-destination STR, -ds STR
   labels subsequent output with the string STR, which is used to
   determine where to deliver the output.  STR is limited to 24
   characters and must be quoted if it contains spaces.  If
   -destination is not specified, the default is your Project_id.  This
   control argument can be overruled by a subsequent -destination.
-forms STR
   indicates the type of forms to be used when processing the print
   file.  Standard I/O daemon drivers ignore the forms specification
   when processing print requests.
-header STR, -he STR
   identifies subsequent output by the string STR.  STR is limited to
   64 characters and must be quoted if it contains spaces.  If -header
   is not selected, the default is your Person_id.  This control
   argument can be overruled by a subsequent -header.


-indent N, -in N
   prints specified paths so that the left margin is indented N
   columns.  If not given, no indentation occurs.
-label STR, -lbl STR
   uses the supplied string as a label at the top and bottom of every
   page (see "Notes" below).
-line_length N, -ll N
   prints specified paths so that lines longer than N characters are
   continued on the following line; i.e., no line of output extends
   past column N.  If not chosen, a line length of 136 characters is
   used.
-no_endpage, -nep
   prints indicated paths so that the printer skips to the top of a
   page only when a form-feed character is encountered in the input
   path.  This control argument ignores -page_length (if present).


-no_label, -nlbl
   does not place any labels on the printed output.
-non_edited, -ned
   prints nonprintable control characters as octal escapes rather than
   suppressing their printing.
-notify, -nt
   sends a confirming message when the requested output is done,
   showing the pathname and charge.
-page_length N, -pl N
   prints no more than N lines per page, where N is the logical page
   length (i.e., the number of lines of user data to appear).  The
   default page length varies depending upon the request type.


-queue N, -q N
   prints supplied paths in priority queue N.  This control argument
   can be overruled by a subsequent -queue; if not specified, the
   default queue for the request type is assumed.  (See "Notes" below.)
-request_type STR, -rqt STR
   places specified paths in the queue for requests of the type
   identified by STR (see "Notes" below).  If not specified, the
   default request type is "printer."
-single, -sg
   prints specified paths so that any formfeed or vertical-tab
   character in any of the paths is printed as a single newline
   character.


-top_label STR, -tlbl STR
   uses the specified string as a label at the top of every page (see
   "Notes" below).
-truncate, -tc
   prints specified paths so that any line exceeding the line length is
   truncated rather than "folded" onto subsequent lines.


Access required:  You require r access to the segment or multisegment
file.

The process that performs the printing (as obtained by
print_request_types) must have at least r access to the file and at
least s access to the containing directory to verify that you also have
at least r access to the file.

If -delete is specified, the I/O coordinator (normally IO.SysDaemon.z)
must have at least m access to the containing directory and at least s
access to the parent directory of the containing directory to verify
that you also have at least m access to the containing directory.


Notes:  If you invoke dprint without any arguments, the system prints a
message giving the status of the default printer queue.

If control arguments are present, they affect only paths specified
after their appearance in the command line.  If control arguments are
specified without a following pathi argument, they are ignored for this
invocation of the command and a warning message is printed.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
