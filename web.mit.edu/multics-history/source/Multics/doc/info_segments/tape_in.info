03/01/85	tape_in

Syntax as a command:  tape_in path {-control_args}


Function: transfers files from magnetic tape to the
storage system.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the control file that governs the file
   transfer.  If path does not end with the .tcl suffix, it is
   assumed.


Control arguments:
-check, -ck
   specifies that only semantic checking be done on the TCL control
   file.	No tapes are mounted if this option is specified.
-ring
   mounts volumes of the volume-set with write permit rings.
-severityN, -svN
   causes the compiler's error messages with severity less
   than N (where N is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4) not to be written into the
   "error_output" I/O switch.	The default value for N is 0.


Notes on the tcl source file:
The control file that governs the file transfer is actually a
program, written by the user, in the Tape Control Language (TCL).
the contents of this control file describe the file transfer.  The
same control file can be used with both the tape_in and tape_out
commands.

For additional information on the TCL, type help tcl.gi.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
