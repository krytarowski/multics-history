07/12/84  delete_dict_words, ddw

Syntax as a command:  ddw path {words} {-control_args}


Function:  The delete_dict_words command deletes one or more words from
a WORDPRO dictionary.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the dictionary.  If path does not have the suffix
   dict, one is assumed; however, dict must be the last component of
   the dictionary segment name.
words
   are words to be deleted from the dictionary.  At least one word is
   required unless -input_file is specified (see below).  If a word is
   not found in the dictionary, a warning message is issued.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the warning message usually given when a word is not
   found in the dictionary.
-count, -ct
   reports the number of words deleted and the number of words in the
   dictionary.
-input_file path, -if path
   deletes from the dictionary the words contained in the segment
   specified by path.  Words in this segment should be separated by
   newlines.  This control argument may be specified more than once.
-word string
   deletes the word string from the dictionary even though string may
   look like a control argument.


Notes:  A word to be deleted from the dictionary must be spelled in its
raw form, i.e., without indicating hyphenation points or the no-trim
attribute (see add_dict_words command above).

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
