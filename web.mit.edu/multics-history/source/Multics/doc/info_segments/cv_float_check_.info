:Entry:  cv_float_check_: 02/01/83  cv_float_check_


Function: takes an ASCII representation of a floating point number and
returns a code indicating the possibility of a conversion error.  (See
also cv_float_ and cv_float_double_.)


Usage (with double precision):
declare cv_float_check_ entry (char(*) fixed bin(35)) returns
     (float bin);
a = cv_float_check_ (string);

Usage (with single precision):
declare cv_float_check_ entry (char(*) fixed bin(35)) returns
     (float bin);
a = cv_float_check_ (string);


Arguments:
string
   is the string to be converted.  (Input)
code
   is a code that equals 0 if no error has occurred; otherwise, it is
   the index of the character of the input string that terminated the
   conversion.  See "Note" below.
a
   is the result of the conversion.  (Output)

Notes:
Code is not a standard status code.  Therefore, it can not be passed to
com_err_ and other subroutines that accept only standard status codes.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
