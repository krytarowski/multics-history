07/16/79  transaction_call, trc

Syntax:  trc opname switchname {args}


Function: This command performs operations on a vfile_ transaction control file
(TCF) I/O switch.


Arguments:
opname
   specifies the operation to perform.  See "List of operations" section below.
switchname
   is the TCF I/O switch name.
args
   depend upon the operation.


List of operations:
assign, a: trc a switchname
   reserves a new transaction number.
commit, c: trc c switchname
   commit the current transaction.
number, n: trc n switchname
   print the current transaction number.
rollback, r: trc r switchname
   rolls back the current transaction.
status, s: trc s switchname {transaction_no} {-control_args}
   prints the status of transaction transaction_no.  If transaction_no is
   omitted or zero, the current transaction number is used.  Control arguments
   may be -brief, -verify.
transact, t: trc t switchname {-control_args} command_line
   executes the command line as a transaction.  The command line need not be
   enclosed in quotes.  Control arguments may be -retry, -signal, -no_signal.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   (status) don't count and print the number of passive and nonpassive
   references made by the transaction.
-verify, -vf
   (status) check all passive references for asynchronous changes.
-retry N
   (transact) specifies maximum number of times to retry the transaction if
   commitment fails.  The default is zero.
-signal
   (transact) if commitment fails and the retry count has been exceeded, signal
   the transaction_failure condition.  This is the default.  After
   transaction_failure has been signaled, program_interrupt will re-execute the
   command line as a transaction.  The start command does not.  The transaction
   is rolled back before transaction_failure is signaled.
-no_signal
   (transact) don't signal the transaction_failure condition if commitment
   fails and the retry count has been exceeded.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
