:Info: daemon.gi: 02/04/82 daemon

     One of several system service processes that perform such tasks
as process creation, backup, network control, and printing segments on
the line printer.


:Info: data_base_manager.gi: 03/05/82 data base manager

     A software system that integrates various computerized
information units of an organization into a total system.  With such a
system, all users of data within an organization share common records
of information and the information available at every level is drawn
from the same source, providing mutually consistent levels of accuracy
to all users.


:Info: directory_hierarchy.gi: 03/05/82 directory hierarchy

     The tree-structured organization of the logical contents of the
Multics storage system.


:Info: discretionary_access.gi: 02/05/82 discretionary access control

     Allows individual users to grant or deny other users access to
their segments and directories at their own discretion.  See
access.info.


:Info: dump.gi: 02/05/82 dump

     Dump refers to the copying of user segments and directories
onto removable storage (magnetic tapes) by the heirarchy backup
system.  The dumping is conventionally done using the processes
Backup.SysDaemon and Dumper.SysDaemon.  The information dumped can
be recovered by the operations staff at the user's request.
See the enter_retrieval_request command.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
