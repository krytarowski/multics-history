Syntax:  .ifi controlargument "long control arg" "short control arg" ...
      OR .ifi ctlarg	"long control arg" "short control arg" ...


Function:
This macro formats control arguments as members of a list of control
arguments (see controlargument_list.compin.info concerning intializing
the control argument list).


Macro action:
1) inserts control argument separation white space as appropriate for
   the device
2) formats "long control arg" and any number of "short control arg"s in
   10pt Helvetica Roman (also see Notes) undented (hanging) by one in-
   dentation level, each on a line by itself


Notes:
1) A call to this macro should be followed by text describing the con-
   trol argument.
2) If "long control arg" and "short control arg" contain white space,
   they must be given as quoted strings.
3) "long control arg" and "short control arg" may contain both literal
   fields and variable fields.  These fields are distinguished in the
   output by presenting the variable fields in 10pt Helvetica Bold
   Italc instead of Roman.  Variable fields are denoted by enclosing
   them between tilde (~) characters.  For example

      "-pathname ~path~"

   will present "pathname" in Roman and "path" in Bold Italic.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
