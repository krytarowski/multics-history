02/13/84  clean_card_pool

Syntax:  clean_card_pool -age N {-control_arg}


Function:  deletes inactive card image segments (in the
>daemon_dir_dir>cards subtree) created by the system card reading
process.

The user must be able to call the system_privilege_ gate to use this
command.


Control arguments:
-age N
   deletes all segments in person directories in the pool whose
   date-time-modified (dtm) is older than N.  Also, all person
   directories whose dtem is older than N are are deleted.
   This control argument is required.
-quota N
   indicates that N pages of unused quota are to be left on each
   remaining access class directory.  If N = 0, then the quota is set
   to the Number of pages used.  The default for N is 0.


Notes:  After the pool is cleaned, all empty person directories and
access class directories are deleted.  All links and directories
contained in a person directory are deleted regardless of age.  All
links and segments in an access class directory are deleted regardless
of age.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
