:Entry: rehash_: 02/08/83 rehash_


Function: (reformats into a different size) a hash table of the form
that is maintained by the hash_ subroutine.  In most cases, hash_
calls rehash_ automatically when a table becomes too full.  For hash
tables that are embedded in larger data bases, the data base
maintainer must monitor the density of the hash table and call rehash_
when necessary to maintain the optimal table size.  See the
description of the hash_ subroutine for more information.


Syntax:
declare rehash_ entry (ptr, fixed bin, fixed bin(35));
call rehash_ (table_ptr, size, code);


Arguments:
table_ptr
   is a pointer to the table to be rehashed.  (Input)
size
   is the new size of the hash table.  (Input).  See the description of
   hash_$opt_size.
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output).  It can be:
   0
      table rehashed successfully.
   error_table_$invalid_elsize
      size is too large.
   error_table_$full_hashtbl
      size is not large enough to hold all the entries in the current
      hash table.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
