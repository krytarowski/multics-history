02/18/85  mtape_delete_defaults

Syntax as a command:  mtape_delete_defaults OPN {-control_args}


Function: deletes default arguments set by the mtape_set_defaults
command.  It deletes the default arguments, from a specified value
segment, that are associated with a given volume type and tape
processing operation.


Arguments:
OPN
   is the type of tape operation (attach, open, close, or detach) that
   uses the default arguments.


Control arguments:
-pathname path, -pn path
   specifies the pathname of a value segment to be searched for default
   arguments.  If you omit it, the value segment >udd>[user
   project]>[user name]>[user name].value is used.
-volume_type VT, -vt VT
   specifies the volume type (ansi or ibm) used by mtape_ to select the
   per-format module for tape processing.  Give -volume_type when you
   specify either the open or close operations; omit it when you supply
   either the attach or detach operations.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
