Syntax:  lac {path {User_id}} {-control_args}


Function:	 scans a directory and lists segments, multisegments, files,
and directories with a specified access for a specified User_id.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the directory to be scanned.  If path is omitted
   or -wd is specified, the working directory is scanned.
User_id
   is an access control name.  It can have null components.  The star
   convention is allowed.  See the description of set_acl in this
   manual.  If User_id is omitted, the User_id of the calling process
   with a star tag is assumed.


Control arguments:
-dir_mode STR
   lists directories to which the named user(s) has any of the modes
   specified in STR, where STR can be any or all of the letters sma.
-seg_mode STR
   lists segments to which the named user(s) has any of the modes
   specified in STR, where STR can be any or all of the letters rew.


Access required:  The user must have status (s) permission on the
directory.


Notes:
You can't use User_id unless you have first supplied a path.

If no control arguments are specified, all the segments and
directories to which the named user(s) has nonnull access are listed.

If there can be more than one User_id (i.e., the specified
User_id has null components), the modes for each matched User_id
and the matched User_id are listed on a per entry basis.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
