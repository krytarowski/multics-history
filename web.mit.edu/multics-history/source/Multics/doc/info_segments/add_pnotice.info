02/20/85  add_pnotice

Syntax:  add_pnotice path {-control_arg}


Function: protects  source  code  programs  by  adding,  at the
beginning of a program,  a software protection notice (copyright,
public domain,  or trade secret  notice) in a box  delimited as a
comment.  Multiple protection notices are supported.  Archives of
source code  programs can be  protected using this  command.  The
archive  pathname  convention  is  supported.   If  a  particular
language or  suffix is not  supported, an appropriate  message is
printed.


Arguments:
path
   is the name of a source  code program, or an archive of source
   programs.  An archive component pathname  may be given to name
   a  single archive  component.  The language  suffix or archive
   suffix must be included.


Control arguments:
-name STR, -nm STR
   where STR  specifies the name of  a protection notice template
   to be added.  "See Notes below".
-default_copyright, -dc
   specifies that  the notice to  be added to the  segment is the
   default  copyright  notice.   Normally,  this  is  a Honeywell
   copyright but  your site may change  the default.  See "Notes"
   below.
-default_trade_secret, -dts
   specifies that  the notice to  be added to the  segment is the
   default  trade secret  notice.  Normally, this  is a Honeywell
   trade secret notice but your site may change the default.  See
   "Notes" below.


-brief, -bf
   suppresses printing  of both the  source program name  and the
   name of the pnotice that was added.
-long, -lg
   specifies  that both  the name of  the source  program and the
   name of  the pnotice are  printed when a  protection notice is
   added.  This is the default.


Notes:
If control arguments are not  specified and there are no existing
pnotices  in  the  program, an  error  message is  issued  and no
changes are made to the program.  If copyright pnotices are found
in  the  program and  the -nm  or -default_copyright  argument is
used, the  ten-year-rule is applied  to the named  pnotice.  That
is, if the notice is more than  nine years old, a new copy of the
notice  is added  with the  current year.   If copyright pnotices
exist and neither the -default_copyright  nor the -nm argument is
used, the  ten-year-rule is applied to  the most recent copyright
pnotice.


A list of available copyright  and trade secret protection notice
template  names  can  be  obtained  with  the  list_pnotice_names
command.  The -name argument can be  used to specify any of these
templates.

A given program may contain several copyright notices, or several
trade  secret  notices  or  a public  domain  notice,  but cannot
contain a mixture of pnotice types.

To  list  the  pnotice  segments in  a  source  program,  use the
display_pnotice command.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
