09/07/83 Introduction:
This info segment describes the user visible changes in the Logical
Inquiry and Update System (LINUS) for the MR10.2 software release.


(1) Report Writer:

LINUS has been augmented to include a Report Writer system. The
following requests make up the system: list_format_options,
set_format_options, save_format_options, restore_format_options,
display, display_builtins, and column_value. Help can be
obtained for any of these requests by typing "help request_name"
once inside LINUS. Typing "help report_writer.gi" provides a
brief introduction to the report writer; typing
"help formatting_options.gi" provides a brief introduction to
the formatting options which control the format of a report.


(2) Multics Active Functions:

The Multics active functions ltrim, rtrim, picture, format_line,
and string are now provided as LINUS active requests. They can be
used in report headers/footers and editing requests to provide
additional formatting functions.


(3) LILA Alternative

A new set of requests have been installed that make it unnecessary to
use the LILA subsystem. The requests "input_query", "print_query",
"save_query", "translate_query", "apply", and "qedx" make up the new
query replacement. Type "help REQUEST_NAME" for details on the usage
of these requests.


(4) Incompatible Changes:

Previously data manipulation requests such as "print" required that
the selection expression be translated before they were invoked. These
requests have been changed to automatically translate the selection
expression if it hasn't already been done.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
