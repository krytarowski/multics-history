08/13/84  display_mrds_db_access, dmdba

Syntax as a command:  dmdba path {-control_args}


Function:  This command displays the current access that the user has
to the data for the relations in the supplied view of the data base.


Arguments:
path
   is the relative or absolute pathname of a data base model or
   submodel, with or without suffix, that supplies the view for which
   the user wishes to see access information.  If both a data model and
   submodel of the same name are in the same directory, then the model
   will be found


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   specifies that a short form of the access information be displayed,
   showing only effective access to the data.
-long, -lg
   specifies that all information related to access be displayed.
   (Default)
-relation rel_name1 ...  rel_nameN
   specifies that only the access for those relations whose names are
   given in the rel_nameI list is to be displayed according to the
   other control arguments.  This control_arg must appear after path.


Notes:  If the data base has been secured, then path must refer to a
secure submodel, unless the user is a DBA.  The user must have
sufficient access to the related model information to open the data
base using the given path.

Control arguments can be overridden, in that the last one specified
takes effect (e.g., -bf followed by -lg implies -lg).

This command only works for version 4 data bases.

The Multics system ACLs, the MRDS access modes, and the result of these
two, an effective access, is displayed for each relation and attribute
in the given view.  Access modes displayed depend on the secured state
of the data base as follows:


     DB SECURED STATE          MODES

           off                 r-e-w
           on                  r-a-m-d

The r-e-w refers to Multics ACLs.  The r-a-m-d refers to the new
attribute level security related operations of read_attr, append_tuple,
modify_attr, and delete_tuple respectively.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
