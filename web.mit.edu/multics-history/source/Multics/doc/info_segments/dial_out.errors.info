Known errors in the current release of dial_out.
#	Associated TR's
Description

23  phx20495
dial_out -raw translates LFs typed by the user into CRs transmitted
down the comm line.  It's difficult to transmit a raw LF.

22  phx18903
"quit" mode should imply tty_ "^hndlquit" mode.

21  phx18645
dial_out raw mode doesn't work in the Video System.

19  phx18127
A recursive invocation of "dial_out -profile X" will terminate
X.profile too many times, causing the outer invocation to fault.  This
error also affects non-recursive uses of dial_out when the profile
being used is also being used by another application (e.g.  the default
command processor profile if the dial_out user just specifies -abbrev
and lets the profile default).

18  phx17769
The terminal type specified with dial_out -ttp should be uppercased
before the set_term_type control order is issued.

16  phx15559
If using "quit" mode, then any error returned while sending the
interrupt because of hitting BREAK causes dial_out to abort the entire
invocation.

15  phx16761 phx19733 phx20154
If there is a syntax error in the "-modes" parameter, random errors,
and sometimes fatal process errors, can occur.  This is because the
cleanup handler restores the cl_intermediary, even though the variable
used to save the cl_intermediary has not been set.

8  phx16403
If you suspend dial_out, change your tty modes, and then start up the
dial_out, when you later exit dial_out your modes will be back the way
they were when you started dial_out initially.

7  phx16150
The send_file request faults if the pathname argument is not given.

5  phx16304
The wait request doesn't always clean up its timer.

3  phx16306
The "quit" and "interrupt" requests do not complain if given arguments,
although they ignore them.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
