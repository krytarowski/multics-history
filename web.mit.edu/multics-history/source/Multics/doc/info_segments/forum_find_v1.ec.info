Syntax:  ec ffv1 SUBTREE_ROOT {RESULT_DIR}


Function: Searches a subtree in the hierarchy for version 1 forum
meetings and for directories which contain links to version 1 meetings.


Arguments:
SUBTREE_ROOT
   Specifies the root of the portion of the hierarchy to be searched.
RESULT_DIR
   Specifies the directory where the resulting files will be placed.
   See "Notes" for a description of the output of this exec_com.
   If this argument is not specified, the files are placed in the
   working dir.


Notes:
This exec_com uses the walk_subtree command to traverse the hierarchy
subtree.  It produces the following five output files:

MEETINGS:  This is a list of all version 1 meetings found in the
subtree.

LINKS: This is a list of all of the directories containing links to
version 1 meetings found in the subtree.

MEETING_ERRORS:  This is a list of errors encountered while examining a
segment to see if it is a version 1 meeting.  This should be a short
file.

LINK_ERRORS:  This is a list of errors encountered while examining
links to see if they point to version 1 meetings.  Examples include
circular links.

ERRORS:  This is a list of other errors encountered. This consists
mostly of incorrect access to directories.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
