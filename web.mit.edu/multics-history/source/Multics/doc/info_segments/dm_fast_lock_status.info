03/22/85 dm_fast_lock_status

Syntax:  dm_fast_lock_status {-control_args}


Function:  Displays the status of all the fast locks currently being held or
awaited on by processes using DM.


Control arguments:
-header, -he
   displays data from the header of the fast lock database.
-no_header, -nhe
   suppresses the display of data from the header of the fast lock database.
   (DEFAULT)
-lock_waiters, -lkw
   displays which processes are waiting on fast locks.  (DEFAULT)
-no_lock_waiters, -nlkw
   suppresses the display of which processes are waiting on fast locks.
-user User_id
   displays fast lock data for locks being waited on by the specified user or
   users.  A User_id can be a starname and is of the form Person.Project.tag.
   Any of the three components can be omitted, along with any trailing periods.
   Omitted components are treated as if they had been "*".  The presence of a
   tag component restricts the search to the corresponding user table.
-process_id PID, -pid PID
   displays fast lock data for locks being waited on by the specified process.
-all_processes, -ap
   displays fast lock data for all fast locks.  (DEFAULT)


Access required:  This command requires e (execute) access to dm_admin_gate_.
The user must have access to the answer_table to use the -user control
argument.


Examples:

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
