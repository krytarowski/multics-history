11/27/80 example.compin, example_off.compin

Syntax: .ifi example {N} {tablename}
     and at the end of the example
        .ifi example_off


Function:
This pair of macros formats a terminal session input/output (or
lineprinter output) example.


Macro Actions:
1) separates the example from main body text by 12 pt of white space
2) generates a ruled box from the current indentation level to the
   right margin to enclose the example
3) increases the indentation level (inside the box) by N+1 (See Notes
   below) for the body of the example.  The default value for N is 0;
   however, if {tablename} is given, N must also be given.
4) sets the body of the example in 9pt ascii font
5) if {tablename} is given; establishes the table format {tablename}
   assuming column 2 of the format in meant for comments, allows for a
   hanging hyphen on the first line of such comments, and sets the
   comments in 10pt Century Schoolbook Roman
6) the example_off entry reverts all the above actions and returns to
   main body text format


Notes:
1) For those devices that do not support ruled lines, use of the -noart
   control argument (see description of compose in AZ98) will suppress
   the ruled box.
2) Examples that exceed one full page are split across pages with the
   box remaining open at the page breaks.
3) The body of the example is normally set 1 indentation level in from
   the main body text.  However, if the example is to display bullets
   (for user input lines) or reference line numbers for use in main
   body text discussion, N must be given as 1 to get the extra space.
   If BOTH bullets and line numbers are wanted, N must be given as 2.
   (See bullet.compin.info, ex_lineno.compin.info, and
   reset_ex_lineno.compin.info for further information on bullets and
   reference line numbers.)

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
