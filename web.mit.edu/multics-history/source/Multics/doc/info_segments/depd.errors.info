Known errors in the current release of depd.

Description

5  phx18738
The following two commands produce different results.  They shouldn't.

   depd error_table_$noentry
   depd >sl1>error_table_$noentry

The error occurs because the absolute pathname form isn't recognized as
a potential error table entry.

4  phx11853
depd should requote the value returned which it is invoked as an active
function.

3  phx09340
get_entry_point_dcl uses invalid code:
  if substr(Aep_name, 1, length("XXX")) = "XXX" then...

This is invalid when Aep_name is shorter than "XXX".

2  phx09270
get_entry_point_dcl_ fails to rtrim whitespace from the name of the
entrypoint argument.

1  phx13822
For procedures which use structures as arguments, certain structure
declarations are inexactly returned as parameter declarations by depd
because the mechanism for encoding argument descriptors does not
provide an adequate description of the alignment of a structure.  The
descriptor only says whether the overall structure is packed or not,
and does not specify whether or not it was originally declared with the
aligned attribute.

Unfortunately, PL/I complains of an argument attribute mismatch if the
structures do not have exactly the same attributes.  See the notes
below for more details.  Also, refer to the TR for a test case which
demonstrates the problem.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
