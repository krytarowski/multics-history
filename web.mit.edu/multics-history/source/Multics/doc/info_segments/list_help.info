Syntax as a command:  lh topics {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [lh topics {-control_args}]


Function: displays the names of all info segments (info segs)
pertaining to a given topic.


Arguments:
topics
   are strings to be searched for in info seg names.


Control arguments:
-absolute_pathname, -absp
   prints or returns full pathnames of info segs, rather than
   entrynames.
-all, -a
   displays the names of all info segs.  (Default: to display the
   names of only those info segs whose names match the topics
   specified)
-brief, -bf
   does not display the alternate names of the info segs.  You can't
   use -brief in the active function.  (Default: to display them)
-no_sort
   does not sort the output.  (Default)


-pathname path, -pn path
   specifies the pathname of a directory to search for applicable
   segments.  Multiple -pathname control arguments are allowed.  (See
   "Notes.")  (Default: to search the directories in the info_segments
   search list)
-sort
   sorts the output in ascending alphabetic order using as key the
   primary name of the info segs.  If you give -absolute_pathname,
   -sort uses the entry name part of it as primary name.


Notes: An info seg is considered to pertain to a given topic if the
topic name appears in (i.e., is a substring of) the info seg name.  The
active function returns the selected names separated by spaces.  For
information on info segs, see the help command.

The default info seg directories contain info segs provided by the site
and those supplied with the system.  Type "print_search_paths
info_segments" to see what the current info segs search list is.  For
information about search lists, see the search facility
commands--add_search_paths, in particular.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
