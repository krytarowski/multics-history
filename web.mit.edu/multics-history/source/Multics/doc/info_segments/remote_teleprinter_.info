03/31/83  remote_teleprinter_


Function: The remote_teleprinter_ I/O module presents a stream I/O
interface to the caller and performs record I/O to a terminal or
printer, which is assumed to be part of a remote I/O device, such as a
Honeywell Level 6 remote batch facility (G115 type), an IBM 2780, or
an IBM 3780.

Entry points in this module are not called directly by users; rather,
the module is accessed through the I/O system.

This module in turn constructs an attach description for the module
specified in the -terminal control argument, passing the attach
information for ASCII or EBCDIC, horizontal tabbing, physical line
length, and all other attach information specified by the caller.


Syntax and Attach Description:
     remote_teleprinter_ -control_args


Control arguments:
   The following control arguments are optional, with the exception of
-terminal:
-horizontal_tab, -htab
   output device has a horizontal tab feature.  The default is no tab
   control.
-physical_line_length N, -pll N
   output device has a maximum line width of N characters.  The default
   is 80 characters.
-physical_page_length N, -ppl N
   output device has a maximum line count per page of N.  The default
   is 66 lines.
-runout_spacing N, -runsp N
   outputs N newline characters with each runout operation.  This
   allows the operator to see messages still under the printer
   mechanism for terminals that have only a printer as an output
   device.  The default is 0.
-terminal STR
   uses the terminal I/O module specified by STR.  This control_arg is
   required.


List of Open Operations:
   The remote_teleprinter_ I/O module supports the stream_input_output
   opening mode.


Put Chars Operation:
The put_chars entry converts a character string ending in a newline
character to an image suitable for printing and transmits this image to
the terminal I/O module.


Get Chars Operation:
The get_chars entry reads the number of specified characters from the
terminal I/O module.


Get Line Operation:
The get_line entry reads one record from the terminal I/O module,
appends a new line, and returns as many characters as requested by the
caller, or the whole record if it is shorter.  If the record is longer
than requested, error_table_$data_loss is returned.


Control Operation:
This I/O module supports all the control operations supported by the
terminal I/O module specified in the attach description.  In addition,
it supports all the control operations supported by the I/O module
remote_printer_.


Modes Operation:
This I/O module supports all the modes supported by the terminal I/O
module specified in the attach description.  In addition, it supports
all the modes supported by the I/O module remote_ printer_.


Position Operation:
This I/O module supports all the position operations supported by the
terminal I/O module specified in the attach description.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
