07/23/84  hyphenate_word_


Function:  The hyphenate_word_ subroutine returns the character
position at which a word can be hyphenated.  The word is located in a
dictionary via the dict search list.


Usage syntax:
declare hyphenate_word_ entry (char(*), fixed bin,
  fixed bin, fixed bin(35));
call hyphenate_word_ (string, space, break, code);

-OR-

declare hyphenate_word_ entry (char(*), fixed bin, fixed bin);
call hyphenate_word_ (string, space, break);


Arguments:
string (input)
   the text word that is to be split.
space (input)
   the number of print positions remaining in the line.
break (output)
   the number of characters from the word that should be placed on the
   current line; it should be at least one less than the value of space
   (to allow for the hyphen), and can be 0 to specify that the word is
   not to be broken.  Thus if the word "calling" is to be split, and
   six spaces remain in the line, the procedure should return the value
   4 (adjustment is performed after hyphenation).


code (output)
   a standard status code.  In order to retain compatibility with an
   older version of this subroutine, this argument is optional,
   depending upon how hyphenate_word_ is declared in the calling
   program.  If this subroutine is called with only three arguments,
   then no code is returned.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
