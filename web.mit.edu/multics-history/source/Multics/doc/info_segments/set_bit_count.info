02/22/85  set_bit_count, sbc

Syntax as a command:  sbc path1 count1 {...pathN countN}


Function: sets a specified bit count on a specified segment,
multisegment file (MSF), data management (DM) file, or extended entry
and changes the bit count author for that entry to be the user who
invoked the command.


Arguments:
pathi
   is the pathname of the entry.  If pathi is a link, the bit count of
   the entry linked to is set.
counti
   is the bit count, in decimal, desired for pathi.


Access required: You must have write access on the entry whose bit
count is to be set.


Notes: Setting the bit count on a directory is permitted, but several
system modules then regard the directory as a MSF.  (See bit_count.gi
and Section 2 of the Programmer's Reference Manual for a description
of the bit count and bit count author.)

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
