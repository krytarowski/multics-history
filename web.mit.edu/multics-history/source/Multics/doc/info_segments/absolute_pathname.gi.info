07/30/86  Absolute pathnames (general information)

An absolute pathname is the entryname of a directory, file or link
preceded by a series of directory names beginning at the root and
leading to the final entryname.  Each directory name and the final
entryname are preceded by a greater-than character (">").


An absolute pathname always begins with a greater-than character.  This
designates the root directory.  The pathname of the root directory is
the only absolute pathname with no entryname.


Notes: See pathname.gi.info for more information on pathnames.


Examples:
   >                  (the root)
   >tools
   >udd>Demo>JQUser>myfile

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
