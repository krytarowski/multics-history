84-07-19  check_sst_size

Syntax:  check_sst_size {-control_args}


Function: displays the sizes of the SST header, AST hash table and
each of the 4 pools that are found in sst_seg along with the total
size of the sst_seg.

Control arguments:
-4k N
   specifies that the 4k AST pool is to have N entries.

-16k N
   specifies that the 16k AST pool is to have N entries.

-64k N
   specifies that the 64k AST pool is to have N entries.

-256k N
   specifies that the 256K AST pool is to have N entries.

-pathname STR, -pn STR
   specifies that the configuration deck with a pathname of STR is to
   be used.


Notes:
If any one of the -4k, -16k, -64k or -256k control arguments are not
used, a configuration deck will be used to supply the missing values.

The configuration deck, if needed, is found with the user's search
rules if the -pathname option is not used on the command line.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
