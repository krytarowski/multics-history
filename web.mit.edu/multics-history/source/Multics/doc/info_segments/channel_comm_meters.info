01/30/84  channel_comm_meters

Syntax:  channel_comm_meters channel_name {-control_args}


Function:  prints out metering information for a specified
communications channel or channels.


Arguments:
channel_name
   is the name of the channel for which information is to be printed.
   If it is the name of an FNP, totals for that FNP are reported.  If
   channel_name is a starname, information for every channel matching
   the starname is printed.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   causes a reduced amount of information to be printed for each
   specified channel.
-error
   causes only those meters to be printed that reflect error
   conditions.
-since_bootload, -boot
   prints the meters accumulated since each channel's parent
   multiplexer (or, in the case of an FNP, the system) was last loaded.
   This control argument is incompatible with -since_dialup (below).


-since_dialup, -dial
   prints the meters accumulated since the channel last dialed up.
   This is the default.  This control argument is incompatible with
   -since_bootload (above).
-summary, -sum
   causes a one-line summary to be printed for each specified channel.
   This control argument may not be specified if either -brief or
   -error is specified.


Notes:  If a single channel is specified, the caller must either be the
current user of the specified channel or have access to either the
metering_gate_ gate or the phcs_ gate.  If a starname is specified, the
user must have access to one of the above-named gates.

If -brief and -error are both specified, then only those error
indications that would be printed with -brief are printed.  See the
example below.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
