03/01/84  pdt_copy

Syntax:  pdt_copy sat_dir pdt_dir admin_dir


Function:  is used by the crank, in master.ec, to copy the system
copies of the SAT and all the PDTs into an administrative directory.
These copies serve both as a backup of the system copies, and as a
summary of the (continually changing) usage figures, from which
accounting programs can compute month-to-date charges.


Arguments:
sat_dir
   is the directory containing the system copy of the SAT (normally
   >sc1).
pdt_dir
   is the directory containing the system copies of the PDTs (normally
   >sc1>pdt).
admin_dir
   is the administrative directory into which the SAT and PDTs should
   be copied (normally >udd>SysAdmin>admin>safe_pdts).


Notes:  This command attempts to copy the PDT of every active project
in the SAT.  If unable to copy a particular PDT, it prints an error
message and continues.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
