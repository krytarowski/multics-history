:Entry: release_area_: 02/06/84  release_area_

Function: cleans up an area after it is no longer needed.


Syntax:
declare release_area_ entry (ptr);
call release_area_ (area_ptr);


Arguments:
area_ptr
   points to the area to be released.  (Input/Output)  area_ptr is
   set to null after copying it to a local variable.


Notes: If the area is a segment acquired via the define_area_
subroutine, the segment is released to the free pool via the temporary
segment manager.  If the area was not acquired (only initialized) via
the define_area_ subroutine then the area itself is reinitialized to
the empty state.  In certain cases when the area is defined by the
system or when the area is extended in ring 0, the temporary segment
manager is not used and the area segments are actually created and
deleted.  Segments acquired to extend the area are released to the
free pool of temporary segments or deleted if they are not obtained
from the temporary segment manager.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
