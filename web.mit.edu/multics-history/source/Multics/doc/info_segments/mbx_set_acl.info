10/17/84  mbx_set_acl, mbsa

Syntax as a command:
   mbsa path mode1 User_id1...modeN {User_idN} {-control_args}


Function:  manipulates the access control lists (ACLs) of mailboxes.
(For a description of ACLs, see the Programmer's Reference Manual.)


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a mailbox; the mbx suffix is assumed.  The star
   convention is allowed.
modei
   is an extended access mode consisting of any or all the letters
   adrosw or null access (n, null, "").
User_idi
   are access control names of the form Person_id.Project_id.tag.  All
   ACL entries with matching names are assigned modeN.  If no match is
   found and you supply all three components, an entry for User_idN is
   added to the ACL.  If you omit the last User_id, your Person_id and
   Project_id are assumed.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the message "No match for User_id on ACL of <path>",
   where User_id omits components.
-chase
   chases links when using the star convention.  Links are always
   chased when path is not a star name.
-no_chase
   does not chase links when using the star convention.  (Default)
-no_sysdaemon, -nsd
   suppresses the addition of a "rw *.SysDaemon.*" term when using
   -replace.


-replace, -rp
   deletes all ACL terms (with the exception of the default
   *.SysDaemon.* term unless you supplied -no_sysdaemon) before adding
   the terms specified on the command line.  The default is to add to
   and modify the existing ACL.
-sysdaemon, -sd
   adds, with -replace, a "rw *.SysDaemon.*" ACL term before adding the
   terms specified on the command line.


Access required:  You need modify permission on the parent directory.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
