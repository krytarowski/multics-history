02/06/84  disk_report, drp, disk_auto

Syntax:  drp


Function:  calculates disk usage and creates a disk usage report.  The
administrator can invoke the disk_report command to cause a manual disk
usage calculation.  Normally, though, disk usage is calculated
automatically every night by the absentee job, dodrp.absin, that
executes the disk_auto command.


Notes:  The sweep program is used to get quota for all directories into
the disk_stat data segment (in >udd>SysAdmin>admin).  The charge_disk
program then charges these usage figures to projects in their
"projfile" entries.  A printable segment, called diskreport, is
produced but not automatically printed.  To print copies of this
segment, type "rqm diskreport".  See the rqm command.

This command examines a large fraction of all the directories in the
hierarchy, placing a heavy load on the system.  Its use during peak
load hours should be avoided if possible.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
