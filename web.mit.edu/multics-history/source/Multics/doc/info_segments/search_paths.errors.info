Known errors in the current release of search_paths.

Description

22  phx14598
The search_paths_$get entrypoint returns the sl_info structure.  The
list_header.update_count field is not incremented if the entire search
list is deleted.  Therefore, an obsolete version of some search_list is
used because it does not know that the list is absolete.


21  phx15867
Assume you have a link named forum.search that points to an object
segment that does not contain the forum_search_ cds component; but it
contains another component with an entrypoint called "forum", then the
print_search_paths command displays a totally useless error message.
For example:

  ! cwd [pd]
  ! ac x >ldd>unb>o>bound_forum_ forum
  ! in forum forum.search -fc
  ! dsp forum -a
  ! psp forum
    Error:  area condition by search_paths_$set|3513
    (>sss>bound_search_facility_)
    Either a variable could not be allocated in an area
    or an area could not be assigned to an existing area.
    system handler for error returns to command level


The search_paths_ could do a much better job of validating that
forum.search$forum is a search list default segment before it goes off
and tries it.  It should print the following message:

"search_list_pathname is not a search list default segment"

rather than taking a fault.


19  phx14548
The EXL add_search_paths commands gets error when it adds a specified
search path name which has an hyphen appeared anywhere in that name to
a specified search list.  For example:

  ! in >exl>sfd>execution>add_search_paths
  ! add_search_paths compose >udd>m>TLNguyen>compose-links
    add_search_paths: Specified control argument is not accepted.
                      >udd>m>TLNguyen>compose-links

Note that the add_search_paths in the >sss library does not get this
error.  So Barry Margolin guesses that the hyphen appeared anywhere in
the search path has caused this error.


14  phx12901
The -no_force control arg for add_search_rules is not implemented.

12  phx12051
add_search_paths allows a path to be entered into a list more than one,
differing only by add names.

11  phx11940
For certain errors, delete_search_rules identifies itself as
'add_search_rules'.


9  phx09886
The search facility doesnt handle explicitly null paths (ie, those
given as "") correctly.

6  phx11766
delete_search_paths does not honor the short keywords -hd, -pd, -rd,
and -wd.


4  phx03790 phx09883 phx12818 phx13325 phx14166
The add_search_paths command displays wrong input argument in the error
message after it found that that input argument is invalid.  For
example:

   ! asp trans -before -working_dir foo
     add_search_paths:  Specified control argument is not accepted. -before

It must report the invalid argument that it just found such as
-working_dir in this example.

3  phx03555 phx05116 phx07934 phx13432
add_search_paths has no feature that allows moving a search path in a
search list, ie., there is no -force control arg.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
