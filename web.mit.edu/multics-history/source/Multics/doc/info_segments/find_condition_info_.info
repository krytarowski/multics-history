:Entry: find_condition_info_: 08/20/81 find_condition_info_

Function: given a pointer to a stack frame being used when a signal
occurred, returns information relevant to that condition.


Syntax:
declare find_condition_info_ entry (ptr, ptr, fixed bin(35));
call find_condition_info_ (stack_ptr, condition_info_ptr, code);


Arguments:
stack_ptr
   is a pointer to a stack frame being used when a condition occurred.
   (Input) It is normally the result of a call to
   find_condition_frame_; if null, the most recent condition frame is
   used.
condition_info_ptr
   is a pointer to the structure (see "Notes" below) in which
   information is returned.  (Input)
code
   is the standard status code.  (Output) It is nonzero when the
   stack_ptr argument does not point to a condition frame or, if the
   stack_ptr argument is null, when no condition frame can be found.


Notes:  The structure that condition_info_ptr points to is declared in
the include file condition_info.incl.pl1.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
