12/22/80  copy_acl_

Syntax:
dcl copy_acl_ entry(char(*),char(*),char(*),char(*), bit(1),
 	    fixed bin(35));
call copy_acl_ (source_dir, source_ent, target_dir, target_ent, 
              target_error_sw, code);


Function:  copies the access control list (ACL) from one file,
segment, multisegment file or directory to another, replacing
the current ACL if necessary.


Arguments: 
source_dir           (Input)
   the pathname of the directory containing the source file or source 
   directory whose ACL is to be copied.
source_ent           (Input)
   the entryname of the source file or source directory.
target_dir           (Input)
   the pathname of the directory containing the target file or target 
   directory whose ACL is replaced.
target_ent           (Input)
   the entryname of the target file or target directory.
target_error_sw      (Output)
   is "0"b if the status code reflects an error in listing the ACL of
   the source file or directory, and is "1"b if the code reflects an
   error in replacing the ACL of the target file or directory.
code          (Output)
   is a standard status code.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
