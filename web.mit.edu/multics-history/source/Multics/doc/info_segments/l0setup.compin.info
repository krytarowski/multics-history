Syntax:  .ifi lXsetup "title-line"


Function:
These macros set up the proper environment and perform all the 'side
effect' processing (including the generation of any implied page
headers) as for the equivalent level header macros, but do NOT emit the
header title or the Table of Contents entries.


Arguments:
'title-line' the text of the section/paragraph title as for the
   equivalent level header macro.


Notes:
1) Use of these macros is generally limited to special addenda work
   (e.g., a long document in which only the last five pages change and
   they are prepared in a new segment or new material is being added
   but kept in a separate segment.)


Examples:
Assume that section 3 of my_doc is about 200 pages long and a summary
portion is being added in addendum A following page 3-125.	The
following lines could be the beginning of that separate summary
segment:

        .ifi init "ZZnn"
        .srv section "3"
        .ifi l0setup "section-3-subject"
        .brp 3-125
        .ifi dot_page
        .srv add_letter "A"
        .srv add_date "7/78"
        .ifi l2h "Summary"
	   A summary of the above is...

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
