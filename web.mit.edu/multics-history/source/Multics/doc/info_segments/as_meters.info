10/28/81 as_meters

Syntax:  as_meters {-control_args}


Function: prints the answering service metering data kept in
>sc1>as_meter_table; optionally does a little bit of analysis of that
data.


Control arguments:
-reset, -rs
   does a reset without printing a report.
-report_reset, -rrs
   does a report and then a reset.
-unreset, -urs
   forgets a previous reset, and prints a report.
-temp_unreset, -turs
   pretends there wasn't a reset while printing this report, but the
   reset is remembered for future reports.
-percent, -pct
   prints 4 lines per meter (default is 1). The extra 3 lines give
   percent of total, usage per call, and page faults per second.
-short, -sh
   formats output to fit in 80 columns, by using cryptic 3-character
   names for all the meters.


-no_header, -nhe
   doesn't print a header.
-totals, -total, -tt
   prints one line giving current time and paging usage for the
   Initializer process.
-meter NAMES, -mt NAMES
   prints only the named meters, and remembers the list in internal
   static, for use in future invocations.  Use "-meter all" to clear
   the list of meters.  The NAMES are the ones printed in either the
   short or long output.  Although the output is capitalized, NAMES
   can be typed in lower or upper case.  The first few letters of the
   name are sufficient, as long as they match one meter name.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
