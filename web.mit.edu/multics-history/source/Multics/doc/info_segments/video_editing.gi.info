           | Right | Control-F     | ESC F     | Control-E      |
    Move   |-------|---------------|-----------|----------------|
    Cursor | Left  | Control-B     | ESC B     | Control-A      |
   --------|-------|---------------|-----------|----------------|
           | Right | Control-D     | ESC D     | Control-K      |

Notes:
The ASCII characters given in the above list are the characters
associated with the corresponding functions by default. These
associations can be displayed with the command

  io_call control WINDOW_SWITCH get_editor_key_bindings key_sequence

and may be changed with the command

  io_call control WINDOW_SWITCH set_editor_key_bindings
    key_sequence1 {user_routine1} {control_args1} ...
    key_sequenceN {user_routineN} {control_argsN}



A "word" is a string of one or more consecutive "token characters".
The set of token characters may be displayed with the command

  io_call control WINDOW_SWITCH get_token_characters

and may be changed with the command

  io_call control WINDOW_SWITCH set_token_characters TOKEN_CHAR_STRING

Type "help window_io_" for details about these commands.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
