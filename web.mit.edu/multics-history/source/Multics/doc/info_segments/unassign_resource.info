12/28/82 unassign_resource, ur

Syntax:  ur resources {-control_args}


Function:  unassigns one or more resources that have been assigned to
the user's process by the Resource Control Package (RCP).


Arguments:
resources
   specify the resources to be unassigned from the user's process.
   Currently, the only resources managed by RCP are devices.  If a
   device is attached, it is automatically detached.


Control arguments:
-admin, -am
   forces an unassignment.  This control argument should be specified
   by highly privileged users who want to unassign a resource that is
   assigned to some other process.
-all
   Specifies that all devices assigned to the process be unassigned.
-comment STR, -com STR
   is a comment string that is displayed to the operator when the
   resource is unassigned.  This comment is displayed only once, even
   if several resources are being unassigned.  (See the assign_resource
   command for details about comment strings.)


Notes:  This command must not be used to unassign a device attached
through the tape_ansi_ or tape_ibm_ I/O module with -retain all
specified.  In that case, the user must specify argument 1 (no
retention) of the retention operation, before detaching the I/O module.
See the descriptions of tape_ansi_ and tape_ibm_ I/O modules.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
