04/11/83  list_imft_requests, lir

Syntax:  lir {request_identifiers} {-control_args}


Function: lists requests in the Inter-Multics File Transfer queues.


Arguments:
request_identifiers
   determine which requests in the selected queues (-queue/-all/-ds/-sc)
   belonging to the specified users (-admin/-own/-user) are listed.  If
   not given, all of the appropriate requests are listed.  See "Notes
   on request identifiers" below.


List of request_identifiers:
path
   lists all requests from the appropriate queues and users whose
   source pathnames match the relative pathname path.  The star
   convention is allowed.
-entry STR, -et STR
   lists all requests from the appropriate queues and users whose
   source entry names match STR; the directory portions of the source
   pathnames are ignored.  The star convention is allowed.
-id STR
   lists all requests from the appropriate queues and users whose
   request IDs match the STR.  Type "help request_ids.gi" for a
   description of the syntax of STR.


Control arguments:
-destination STR, -ds STR
   lists requests that are queued for transfer to the remote system
   identified by STR.  STR must be one of the names listed by the
   print_imft_sites command.
-source STR, -sc STR
   lists requests that are queued for transfer from the remote system
   identified by STR.  STR must be one of the names listed by the
   print_imft_sites command.  If neither -destination nor -source is
   specified, the default is -destination imft.
-queue N, -q N
   lists requests entered in priority queue N for the above destination
   or source where N is an integer between 1 and 4 inclusive.  (Default
   -- depends on the destination or source specified)
-all, -a
   lists requests entered in all priority queues for the above
   destination or source.


-brief, -bf
   displays minimal information for each request including its request
   ID, source pathname, and current state.  (Default)
-long, -lg
   displays all information available for each request.
-total, -tt
   displays only the total number of matching requests in each queue.
-position, -psn
   includes the position within the queue of each request.
-no_position, -npsn
   does not include the position within the queue.  (Default)


-long_id, -lgid
   displays the complete request ID for each request.  (Default if
   -long is used)
-short_id, -shid
   displays the short form of the request ID for each request.
   (Default if -long is not used)
-absolute_pathname, -absp
   displayes the absolute pathname of the file or subtree associated
   with each request.  (Default if -long is used)
-entryname, -etnm
   displays only the entry name of the file or subtree.  (Default if
   -long is not used)


-admin, -am
   lists the matching requests submitted by any user.
-own
   lists a matching request only if it was submitted by the user of
   this command.  (Default)
-user STR
   lists a matching request only if it was submitted by the user
   identified by STR.


List of user specifications:
   the STR given to the -user control argument must have one of the
   following forms:
Person.Project
   lists only those matching requests entered by the specified user
   while logged in on the specified project.
Person.*, Person
   lists only those matching requests entered by the specified user
   while logged in on any project.
*.Project, .Project
   lists only those matching requests entered by any user logged in on
   the specified project.
*.*, *
   lists all matching requests regardless of who entered them.


Access required: If -position, -admin, or -user is specified, at least
"r" extended access is required to the queues; otherwise, at least "o"
extended access is required.


Notes on request identifiers: If path or -entry STR request identifiers
are given, only one -id STR request identifier may be given in which
case only those requests which match one of the path or -entry STR
identifiers and which match the -id STR identifier are listed.


Notes:
If conflicting control arguments (eg: -position and -no_position, or
-destination and -source) are given on the command line, the rightmost
control argument takes effect.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
