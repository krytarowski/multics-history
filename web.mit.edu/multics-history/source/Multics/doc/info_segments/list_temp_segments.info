10/08/80	list_temp_segments

Syntax:  list_temp_segments {names} {-control_arg}


Function:
     The list_temp_segments command lists the segments currently in the
temporary segment pool associated with the user's process.	This pool
is managed by the get_temp_segments_ and release_temp_segments_
subroutines (described in the MPM Subroutines).


Arguments:
names
   is a list of names identifying the programs whose temp segments are
   to be listed.  If no names are specified, temp segments for all
   programs are listed.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   lists all temporary segments including free ones This control
   argument is incompatible with name arguments.	If the command is
   issued with no control argument, it lists only those temporary
   segments currently assigned to some program.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
