02/02/79  print_attach_table, pat

Syntax:  pat {switch_names} {-control_args}


Function: prints a list of I/O switches and information about them.


Arguments: 
switch_names
   are starnames used to select the switches to be processed.
   If no switch_names are specified, all I/O switches that are currently
   attached are processed.


Control arguments: 
-name switch_name, -nm switch_name
   causes the next argument to be interpreted as a literal switchname, even if
   it looks like a starname or control argument.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the processing of the four standard switches (user_input,
   user_output, user_i/o and error_output)
-all, -a
   processes all switches, even those that are not attached.
-attached, -att
   processes only attached switches. This is the default.
-open
   processes only open switches.


Notes: The output from this command is a table listing the name of each switch
processed, its attach description (if attached) and its open description (if
open). The switches processed are selected by starname match and by whether
they match the criteria specified by the control arguments.


Syntax as an active function:  
	[pat {-control_args} {switch_names}]
returns a string containing the names of all the switches selected,
separated by spaces.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
