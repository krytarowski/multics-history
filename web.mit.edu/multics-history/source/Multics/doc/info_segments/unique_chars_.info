:Entry: unique_chars_: 02/03/84  unique_chars_


Function: provides a character-string representation of a bit string.
If the bit string is supplied by the unique_bits_ subroutine, this
character string is unique among all character strings generated in
this manner in the history of this Multics installation and is
therefore useful as an identifier.


Syntax:
declare unique_chars_ entry (bit(*)) returns (char(15));
char_string = unique_chars_ (bits);


Arguments:
char_string
   is a unique character string.  (Output)
bits
   is a bit string of up to 70 bits.  (Input) See "Notes" below.


Notes:  If the bits argument is less than 70 bits in length,
unique_chars_ pads it with zeros on the right to produce a 70-bit
string.  If the bits argument equals zero, unique_chars_ calls
unique_bits_ to obtain a unique bit string.

The first character in the character string produced is always an
exclamation point to identify the string as a unique identifier.  The
remaining 14 characters that form the unique identifier are
alphanumeric, excluding vowels.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
