11/26/80  fortran_77.conversions

This info segment outlines some suggested procedures for converting
FORTRAN programs fron ansi66 to ansi77.  The implementation of FORTRAN
77 on Multics is not yet complete, so this list of suggested
conversion procedures may grow with future releases.  The paragraphs
below are titled:

	common blocks
	equivalence groups
	default character string length
	packed character string layout
	zero trip DO loop
	blank lines


common blocks:
Under the ansi77 option, it is invalid to mix character mode variables
and variables of other modes within a single common block.  Common
blocks in ansi66 programs that contain both character and
non-character data must be split into two separate common blocks, one
for character data and one for non-character data.


equivalence groups:
Under the ansi77 options, it is invalid to equivalence character mode
variables with variables of other modes.  Such equivalencing in ansi66
programs should be replaced with explicit assignment statements.  For
complex and double precision data, the corresponding character
variable should be given the length 8.  For integer, real, and logical
data, the corresponding character variable is of length 4.

Whenever the storage in question is to be viewed as non-character
data, the program should explicitly assign the character value to an
integer, real, etc. variable.  Whenever the storage is to be viewed
as character data, it may be inspected directly.


default character string length:
Under the ansi77 option, the default length for character variables
has changed from 8 to 1.  To avoid ambiguity, all CHARACTER statements
in the program should be inspected to ensure that every character mode
variable has an explicitly declared length.


packed character string layout:
The representation of character data in storage is different under the
ansi77 option.  This change in storage layout will most seriously
affect programs which use permanent common blocks (those whose names
end with "$") or unformatted files which contain character data and
which were written by an ansi66 program.

ansi77 programs can access character data in ansi66 format as follows:
for each character datum in ansi66 format, the ansi77 program should
declare a corresponding character datum.  The length of the character
datum in the ansi77 program should be the smallest multiple of 4 that
is greater than or equal to the length declared in the ansi66 program.
For example, a CHARACTER*15 variable becomes CHARACTER*16, and a
CHARACTER*32 variable remains CHARACTER*32.

The next step is to use the substring notation wherever an ansi77
variable is used to access ansi66 data.  If the variable was declared
CHARACTER*15 in the ansi66 program, the ansi77 program should
reference a CHARACTER*16 variable with the substring notation (1:15).

This technique can be used in converting old format data to the new
format by reading the data as described above, and writing the data to
a new file or common block straightforwardly with an ansi77 program.


zero trip DO loop:
For ansi66 programs being converted to ansi77, each DO loop must be
examined.  If the logic of the program depends on the loop body being
executed at least once in all circumstances, the final loop value
should be changed to use the MAX or MIN intrinsic function.  For
example, the statement

	DO 100 I = J,K

might be changed to 

	DO 100 I = J,MAX(J,K)

to ensure that the loop is executed at least once under the ansi77
option.  If the increment is known to be negative, the MIN intrinsic
function should be used instead of MAX.


blank lines:
The interpretation of a blank line differs in the ansi66 and ansi77
options.  In ansi66, it is interpreted as an initial line, i.e.  it
begins a statement, whereas in ansi77, it is ignored.  This will
present no difficulty in all but the most pathological cases.


Consider the following program:

%options card;
      program blank_line
      integer foo, foogoto5, k
      data foo /66/, foogoto5 /77/
      k = foo

     &go to 5
  100 format (" This was compiled with the ansi", i2, " option.")
    5 write (6, 100) k
      stop
      end

If this program compiled with the ansi66 option, it will set  k to the
value of the variable foo, because the blank line terminates the
assignment.  If compiled with the ansi77 option, it will set k to the
value of foogoto5, because the blank line is ignored and the what we
might think of as the goto statement is considered part of the
assignment statement.  If the ansi66 semantics of this program were
desired while compiling under the ansi77 option, it would be necessary
to insure that the goto statement was not interpreted as a
continuation line to the assignment.  The remedy is to simply remove
the continuation marker in column six.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
