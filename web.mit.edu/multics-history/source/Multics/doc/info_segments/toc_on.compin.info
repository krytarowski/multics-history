02/20/80	toc_on.compin

Syntax:  .ifi toc_on


Function:
This compose macro turns on the automatic generation of a Table of
Contents.


Notes:
1) If this macro is used in <file>.compin, the desired Table of
   Contents is accumulated in a segment named <file>.toc.compin.
2) The macro need be used only once for a document, but its repeated
   use does no harm and the segment accumulating the Table of Contents
   is not changed.	If <book>.compin is a "driver" file that inserts
   <file>.compin as a section and both use this macro, the Table of
   Contents for <file>.compin will be added to <book>.toc.compin.


Example:
The following is a sample 'book' compin segment named AAnn_book.compin.

        .ifi init_mpm "AAnn"
        .ifi toc_on
        .ifi fig_on
        .ifi tab_on
        .ifi AAnn.tp
        .ifi AAnn.pf
        .ifi s1
        .ifi s2
	    .
	    .
	    .
        .ifi AAnn_book.toc
        .ifi AAnn_book.fig
        .ifi AAnn_book.tab

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
