02/08/84  heals_report

Syntax:  heals_report {report_names} {-control_args}


Function: produces reports of interest to site-support and
field-engineering personnel.  The reports are appended to a report
file specified in -output_file or by default to the heals_reports
segment in the working directory.  The ASCII report segment can be
displayed, perused by you on the terminal, or printed on a high-speed
line printer.


Arguments:
report_names
   can be one or more names from the following list (see -all below):
   io_error
      selects the I/O error report.
   sorted_io_error
      selects the sorted I/O error report.
   media_io_error
      is similar to the sorted io error report except that the primary
      sort key is the media volume name (e.g., tape reel number).
   cpu_error
      selects the CPU error report.
   mos_edac_error
      selects the MOS EDAC error report.


Control arguments:
-output_file path, -of path
   puts the report file in the file specified by path.
-from DT, -fm DT
   specifies the date and time after which errors are reported.  If
   this argument is not given, the default value is the value of -to
   time minus 24 hours.
-to DT
   specifies the date and time up to which errors are reported.  If
   this argument is not given, the default value is the current date
   and time.
-all, -a
   specifies that all reports are to be generated.  This argument can
   be used instead of listing all report names.


Notes: The dates specified after -fm, -from, and -to must be
acceptable to convert_date_to_binary_ (see the Subroutines manual).


Access required: You must have r access on
>system_control_1>heals_dir>heals_log.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
