1983-10-28 Limitations in MRPG 1.1b

There are 2 areas where at least one user has run into a limitation of
MRPG which the user may work around.  These limits are not set high
because of the overhead involved in doing so, which every user of very
small amounts of data would have to pay for.  Here is described what
the big user needs to know to adjust to his need.


Number of variables declared:  The maximum is controlled by a
statement in mrpg.mrpg_lib.  The released library says
  &ext dclist{100}&;
This says that only 100 variable names may be defined.  Anyone needing
more may change the value of "100".


TABLE/SET size: The number of elements in a table or set is defined by
these 2 statements:
  &int fromlist{100}&;
  &int tolist{100}&;
The "100"s here may be increased to the size which the user needs.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
