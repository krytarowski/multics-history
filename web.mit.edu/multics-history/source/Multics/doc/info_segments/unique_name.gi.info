:Info: unique_name.gi: 02/26/82 unique name (shriek name)

     A name, generated from a system clock value, that is guaranteed
to be different from any other name so generated (e.g.,
!BBBnZNlqLQddRJg).  See the description of the unique command.


:Info: upgraded_directory.gi: 02/26/82 upgraded directory

     An upgraded directory is one that has an access class greater
than that of its parent.


:Info: user_dir_dir.gi: udd.gi: 02/26/82 user_dir_dir (udd)

     The user directory directory, which contains all project
directories.  Its pathname is >udd, and all user segments and
directories are subordinate to it.


:Info: User_id.gi: user_id.gi: 02/26/82 User_id

     A character string representing a user or group of users (also
referred to as "access identifier").  It consists of three components:
Person_id.Project_id.tag.  A User_id is often used as an argument to a
command.  Depending on the specific command, sometimes all the
components are not specified (for example, the tag component is often
omitted).  The star convention may be used, also depending on the
command being invoked.  (Refer to the relevant command description in
the MPM Commands to see if the command in question accepts these
conventions).  For a description of the tag component, see 
instance_tags.gi.info.


:Info: volume_backup.gi: 02/26/82 volume backup

     A backup system which operates at the physical storage volume
level.  It provides physical volume rebuilding in the event of a
failure, as well as segment and subtree retrieval.


:Info: volume_label.gi: 02/26/82 volume label

     A label on each physical volume that identifies that volume to
the system.


:Info: VTOC.gi: vtoc.gi: 02/26/82 VTOC

     Volume table of contents.  Each physical volume contains a VTOC

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
