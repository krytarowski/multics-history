01/27/84  display_account_status, das

Syntax:  das {Project_id} {-control_args}


Function: allows system administrators to print the latest accounting
information for a project.  The information is stored in the PDT of
that project and is correct as of the last time the daily accounting
job was run; it is usually run every night.


Arguments:
Project_id
   is the Project_id of the project.  If this argument is not given,
   the project under which the project administrator is currently
   logged in is assumed.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   prints a one-line summary of the account information.
-long, -lg
   prints all information found in the projfile (project registration
   segment) entry and the reqfile (requisition segment) entry.
-no_header, -nhe
   suppresses printing of the header.


Notes:  The user must have read access to the PDT to use this command;
usually only project administrators have such access.

If neither the -brief nor -long control argument is given, all
information about charges is printed.

For more information on the projfile and reqfile entries, see MAM --
System Administrator (AK50).  See also the proj_usage_report command
to get a brief summary of each user's resource consumption and the
print_pdt command to get more detailed information about each user.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
