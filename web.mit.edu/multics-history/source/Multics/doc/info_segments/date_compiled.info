07/04/86  date_compiled, dtc

Syntax as a command:  dtc path {-control_arg} {components}


Syntax as an active function:  [dtc path {-control_arg} {components}]


Function:  prints the date and time compiled and the compiler
identifier for an object file or an archive of object segments.  For
a bound object file, the command prints the date and time compiled
for each component.

The active function returns the first line of output that would be
printed if it were invoked as a command.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of an object segment, bound object segment,
   bound object MSF, or an archive of object segments.
components
   are names of components in a bound object file or archive of
   object segments.  If component names are supplied, information on
   only these components is listed.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   lists the date and time compiled only.
-long, -lg
   lists the date and time compiled, the file name, your User_id,
   and the long form of the compiler identifier.


Notes:  If an archive is listed, the bind file is ignored.

If neither control argument is specified, the command lists the date
and time compiled, the file name, the User_id, and the short
compiler identifier.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
