02/28/84  clear_partition

Syntax:  clear_partition pvname partname {-control_args}


Function: overwrites the contents of a disk partition with zeros or an
optional user-supplied pattern word.


Arguments:
pvname
   is the name of the physical volume on which the partition to be
   cleared exists.
partname
   is the name of the partition to be cleared.  It must have four
   characters or less.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   produces brief format messages.
-long, -lg
   produces long messages.  (Default)
-pattern word
   overwrites the partition with data consisting of the specified octal
   pattern word. The specified word is written into every location in
   the partition.  If -pattern is not specified, a default of all zeros
   is used.


Access required: Access to the phcs_ and hphcs_ gates is required.


Notes: You are always queried whether the partition should be
overwritten; by default (if -brief was not specified) the contents of
the first eight words in the partition are displayed (in octal and as
ASCII characters) as part of this question, to aid in preventing
accidental overwriting of the wrong partition.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
