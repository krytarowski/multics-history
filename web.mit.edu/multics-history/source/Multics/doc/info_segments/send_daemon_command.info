04/08/85 send_daemon_command

Syntax as a command:
   send_daemon_command request source_id {Personid.Project}
   {command_line}


Function:  allows control over daemon processes from normal user
processes.  This command may be used to send an arbitrary command line
to a daemon, send a QUIT signal to a daemon, log in a daemon, and log
out a daemon.


Arguments:
request
   is a keyword which represents the desired action to be performed.
   It can be either "login", "logout", "reply", or "quit".
source_id
   is the message coordinator source id over which the daemon of
   interest is logged in (or is to be logged in).
Personid.Project
   is the userid which must be supplied for the login request and is
   not allowed for any other request.  It specifies which userid to
   login over the specified source_id
command_line
   is the command line to be sent to the daemon for the "reply"
   request, and the optional login arguments for the "login" request.
   The command line cannot be supplied for the "logout" or "quit"
   requests.  If the command line contains special characters, you must
   enclose them (or the whole command line) in quotes.


Access Required:  If the installation parameter
validate_daemon_commands is not enabled, RW access to
>sc1>admin_acs>send_daemon_command.acs is required to use this command.

If the validate_daemon_commands installation parameter is enabled,
access to individual daemons is controlled by the ACL on message
coordinator access control segments (MCACS) located in the directory
>sc1>mc_acs.  For example, the ACL on >sc1>mc_acs>rp.mcacs controls
access to use of the "rp" source_id.  "c" access is required to use the
"login" or "logout" requests, "q" access is required to use the "quit"
request, and "r" access is required to use the "reply" request.  For
the "login" request, the daemon specified by Personid.Projectid must
have "d" access to the MCACS segment.


Examples:
send_daemon_command login rp Repair.SysDaemon -auth system_high

send_daemon_command quit rp

send_daemon_command reply rp pwd

send_daemon_command logout rp

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
