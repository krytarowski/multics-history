:Entry: add_bit_offset_: 06/15/81  add_bit_offset_

Function: returns a pointer to a bit relative to the bit referenced by
the input pointer.  The displacement to the desired bit may be
positive, negative, or zero.


Syntax:
dcl add_bit_offset_ entry (ptr, fixed bin (24)) returns (ptr)
     reducible;
new_pointer_value = add_bit_offset_ (pointer_value, bit_displacement);


Arguments:
pointer_value
   is the original pointer to which the bit displacement is applied.
   (Input)
bit_displacement
   is the displacement in bits to be applied to the above pointer.
   (Input)
new_pointer_value
   is the result of this operation.  (Output)


Notes: If the result of applying the displacement would cause the
pointer to reference outside the legal boundaries of a segment (either
a negative offset or an offset beyond 256K words), the result of the
call is not defined.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
