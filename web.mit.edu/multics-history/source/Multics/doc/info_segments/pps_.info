Syntax: pps_ {volids} {-control_args}


Function: provides iox_ I/O module interface to offline PPS.


Arguments:
volid
   name of tape volume for output.


Control Arguments:
-bottom_label STR, -blbl STR
   specifies bottom page label.
-char_table ENTRY, -ct ENTRY
   specifies PPS character table name.
-density N, -den N
   specifies tape density.
-label STR, -lbl STR
   specifies both top and bottom page labels.
-modes STR, -mds STR
   specifies initial modes. See Modes below.
-number N, -nb N
   specifies starting file number.
-retain STR, -ret STR

-top_label STR, -tlbl STR
   specifies top page label.
-volume STR, -vol STR
   specifies additional tape volume names.


Open Operation:  Only stream _output is supported.
   
   
Control Operation: Several control orders are supported.  For details
   see Multics Page Processing System Utility Manual (CJ97).
   
   
Modes Operation:  Supported whenever the I/O switch is attached.  The

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
