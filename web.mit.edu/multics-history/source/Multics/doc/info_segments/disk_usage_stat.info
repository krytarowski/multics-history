02/21/84  disk_usage_stat

Syntax:  disk_usage_stat path


Function:  gathers statistics on a hierarchy subtree.  It produces a
report describing the number of segments, links, directories, and names
by hierarchy depth; distribution of segments by date of last reference
and last modification; distribution by segment size; distribution by
number of names; directory distribution by number of names; counts by
starname.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname that specifies the hierarchy inferior to path to be
   scanned.  The default is ">".


Notes:  The report is typed on the user's terminal.

The listing by starname is controlled by the contents of the segment
starname_list in the user's working directory.  This segment consists
of starnames, one per line.  If the starname_list segment does not
exist, a single starname, **, which matches all entries, is assumed.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
