07/23/84  list_dict_words, ldw

Syntax as a command:  ldw path {words} {-control_args}


Function:  The list_dict_words command displays a list of words in a
wordpro dictionary.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the dictionary to be listed.  If path does not
   have the suffix dict, one is assumed; however, dict must be the last
   component of the dictionary segment name.
words
   are words to be listed.  If no words are specified, and if the
   -input_file control argument is not specified, all words in the
   dictionary are listed.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the warning message usually given when a word is not
   found in the dictionary.
-input_file path, -if path
   lists the words contained in the segment specified by path.  Words
   in this segment should be separated by newlines.  This control
   argument may be specified more than once.
-output_file path, -of path
   writes words to be listed into the segment specified by path instead
   of printing words on the user's terminal.  The words are separated
   by newlines in the output segment.


-raw
   displays the words without indicating the no-trim attribute or
   hyphenation points.  Otherwise, words are listed in the format
   accepted by the add_dict_words command above.
-word string
   lists the word string even though string may look like a control
   argument.


Notes:  When listing an entire dictionary, or any large number of
dictionary words, it may be convenient to use the list_dict_words
command together with the print_wordlist command to obtain multiple
column output.  This is accomplished by using the -output_file control
argument to create a wordlist (i.e., a segment whose entryname has the
suffix wl).  The resulting wordlist can then be printed by the
print_wordlist command.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
