10/20/86  change_symbols, csb

Syntax as a command:  csb symbol {-control_args}


Function:  changes the expansion or suffixing of specified symbol.
Control arguments are processed one at a time.  Specifying more than
one control argument has the same effect as issuing the command several
times with one control argument each time.


Arguments:
symbol
   is the symbol changed.  This symbol must be defined in the current
   symbol dictionary.


Control arguments:
-exp STR
   where STR represents the new expansion STR for this symbol.  This
   control argument does not change the way suffixing is performed for
   the symbol.
-suffix STR
   enables or disables suffixing for this symbol.  STR must be either
   "on" or "off".  If STR is on, then suffixing is enabled and all
   suffixes are processed according to the default rules.  If STR is
   off, then all suffixes are disabled for the symbol.  (Default is
   on.)


-plural STR
   defines the plural suffix for this symbol.  STR must be "on" or
   "off", or a STR that can be used as the plural of the expansion of
   this symbol.  If STR is on, then the plural suffix is enabled for
   this symbol and processed according to the default rules for the
   plural suffix.  If STR is off, the plural suffix is disabled for
   this symbol.
-ed STR
   defines the ed suffix for this symbol.  This control argument
   follows the same rules as the -plural control argument.
-ing STR
   defines the ing suffix for this symbol.  This control argument
   follows the same rules as the -plural control argument.


-er STR
   defines the er suffix for this symbol.  This control argument
   follows the same rules as the -plural control argument.
-ly STR
   defines the ly suffix for this symbol.  This control argument
   follows the same rules as the -plural control argument.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
