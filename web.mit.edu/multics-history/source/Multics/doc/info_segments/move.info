12/08/88  move, mv

Syntax as a command:
   mv move path1 {path2...path1N path2N} {-control_arg}


Function: moves a specified segment, multisegment file, data
management file, and extended entry (along with its access control list
and all names) to a new position in the storage system hierarchy.


Arguments:
path1
   is the pathname of a segment or multisegment file to be moved.  The
   star convention is allowed.
path2
   is the pathname to which path1 is to be moved.  The equal convention
   is allowed.  If you don't give the last path2 segment, path1 is
   moved to your working directory and given the entryname path1.


Control arguments:
-acl
   copies the ACL.  (Default)
-all, -a
   copies multiple names and ACLs.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the messages "Bit count inconsistent with current
   length..."  and "Current length is not the same as records used...."
-chase
   copies the targets of links that match path1 (see "Notes").
-long
   prints warning messages as necessary.  (Default)
-name, -nm
   copies multiple names.  (Default)


-no_acl
   does not copy the ACL.  The segment is given the IACL of the target
   directory.
-no_chase
   does not copy the targets of links that match path1 (see "Notes").
-no_name, -nnm
   does not copy the multiple names.


Access required: You need read access for path1, status and modify
permission for the directory containing path1, and status, modify, and
append permission for the directory containing path2.


Notes: The default for chasing links depends on path1--if it is a
star name, links are not chased by default; if it is not, links are
chased.

If the primary name of path1 is the only one, it is added as a
secondary name to path2.

If an entry with the entryname path1 already exists in the target
directory, you are asked whether the already-existing entry should be
deleted.  If you answer "no," the move does not take place.

If path1 is protected by the safety switch, you are asked whether you
want to delete path1 after it has been moved.


If moving a non-empty mailbox requires that the max_length
characteristic of the source be applied to the target, then the target
max_length value will take on the default value that was given it when
created.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
