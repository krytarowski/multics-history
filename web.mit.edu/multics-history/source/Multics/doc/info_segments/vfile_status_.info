:Entry: vfile_status_: 02/03/84  vfile_status_


Function: returns various items of information about a file supported
by the vfile_ I/O module.


Syntax:
declare vfile_status_ entry (char(*), char(*), ptr, fixed bin(35));
call vfile_status_ (dir_name, entryname, info_ptr, code);


Arguments:
dir_name
   is the pathname of the containing directory.  (Input)
entryname
   is the entryname of the file of interest.  (Input) If the entry is a
   link, the information returned pertains to the entry to which it
   points.
info_ptr
   is a pointer to the structure in which information is to be
   returned.  (Input) See "File information" below.
code
   is a storage system status code.  (Output)


File information:
The info_ptr argument points to one of the following structures which
are all declared in the include file vfs_info.incl.pl1.

For unstructured files, use the uns_info structure.

For sequential files, use the seq_info structure.

For blocked files, use the blk_info structure.

For indexed files, use the indx_info structure.


Notes:  The user must provide the storage space required by the above
structures.  The following declaration:

        dcl info aligned like indx_info;

will provide the necessary space for the largest of the structures.

See the description of the vfile_ I/O module for further details.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
