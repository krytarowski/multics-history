Syntax as a command:  an path names {-control_args}


Function: adds alternate name(s) to a segment, multisegment file,
directory, link, data management file, or extended entry.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a segment, multisegment file, directory, link, or
   extended entry.  This argument can be "-name STR" to specify a
   nonstandard name, such as one beginning with a minus sign or
   containing * or >.  The star convention is allowed, but does not
   apply to STR.
names
   are additional names to be added.  This argument can be "-name STR".
   The equal convention is allowed, but does not apply to STR.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the error message "Name already on entry".
-interpret_as_extended_entry, -inaee
   interpret the selected entry as an extended entry type.
-interpret_as_standard_entry, -inase
   interpret the selected entry as a standard entry type.
-long, -lg
   does not suppress the error message "Name already on entry".
   (Default)


Access required: You need modify permission on the parent directory.


Notes: Two entries in a directory cannot have the same entryname;
therefore, add_name takes special action if the added name already
exists.  If the added name is an alternate name of another entry, the
name is removed from this entry, added to the entry specified by path,
and you are informed of this action.  If the added name is the only
name of another entry, you are asked whether to delete this entry.  If
you answer "yes", the entry is deleted and the name is added to the
entry specified by path; if you answer "no", no action is taken.

See the delete_name and rename commands.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
