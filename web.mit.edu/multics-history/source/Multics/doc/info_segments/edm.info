03/05/84  edm

Syntax:  edm {path}


Function: invokes a simple Multics text editor for creating and
editing ASCII segments.  This command cannot be called recursively.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the segment to be created or edited.  If path is
   not specified, edm begins in input mode (see "Notes"), ready to
   accept whatever is subsequently typed as input.  If path is given,
   but the segment does not yet exist, edm also begins in input mode.
   If path specifies a segment that already exists, edm begins in edit
   mode.


List of editor requests:
   ,	   comment mode
   -	   backup
   .         mode change
   =	   print current line number
   E	   execute
   b	   bottom
   c	   change
   d	   delete
   f	   find
   i	   insert
   k	   kill
   l	   locate
   merge	   insert segment
   move	   moves lines within segment


   n	   next
   p	   print
   q	   quit
   qf	   quitforce
   r	   retype
   s	   substitute
   t	   top
   updelete  delete to pointer
   upwrite   write to pointer (upper portion of segment)
   v	   verbose
   w	   write


Notes: The edm editor operates in response to requests from you.  To
issue a request, put edm in edit mode which is entered in two
ways: if the segment already exists, it is entered automatically when
edm is invoked; if dealing with a new segment (and edm has been in
input mode), the mode change character (the period) must be issued as
the only character on a line.  The editor announces its mode by
typing "Edit." or "Input." when the mode is entered.  From edit mode,
input mode is also entered via the mode change character.


The edm requests are predicated on the assumption that the segment
consists of a series of lines to which there is a conceptual pointer
that indicates the current line.  (The top and bottom lines of the
segment are also meaningful.) Various requests explicitly or
implicitly cause the pointer to be moved; other requests manipulate
the line currently pointed to.  Most requests are indicated by a
single character, generally the first letter of the name of the
request.  For these requests, only the single character, not the full
request name, is accepted by the command.  Certain requests have been
considered sufficiently dangerous, or likely to confuse you, that
their names must be specified in full.


For the q (quit) request, if a w (write) has not been done since the
last change to the text then edm warns you that changes made may be
lost and asks you whether you still wish to exit.  If no changes have
been made since the last w, then you exit directly.  The qf (quit
force) request bypasses this check.

The edm command has three modes--input, edit, and comment.  If the
path argument is specified and the segment is found, edm begins in
edit mode; otherwise, it begins in input mode.  In edit mode, edm
accepts and performs edit requests.  In input mode, all lines typed
are appended to the file until a line consisting of a period (.) is
typed, causing it to return to edit mode.  In comment mode, one line
at a time of the file is printed without carriage return, and you can
append to the end of the line by typing a continuation, or can type
"." to cause a return to edit mode.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
