03/06/85  forum_add_participant, fapt

Syntax as a command:  fapt meeting_name Person_id {-control_args}


Function:  makes the person identified by Person_id eligible to attend
the meeting_name meeting.  You can use this request if you have either
modify permision on the containing directory or chairman access to the
meeting.


Arguments:
meeting_name
   is the pathname or entryname of the meeting to be adjusted.
   Pathnames contain greater-than (>) or less-than (<) characters.  If
   a pathname is specified, it identifies the meeting to be adjusted.
   Otherwise, fapt searches for the meeting_name by using the forum
   search list.
Person_id
   is the Person_id of the participant to be added.


Control arguments:
-chairman, -cm
   gives chairman access to the added participant.  This control
   argument is not valid for meetings created with pre-MR11 software.
-read_only, -ro
   allows the added participant to read transactions but not enter
   them.


Notes:  The -read_only and -chairman control arguments cannot both be
specified.

To change the access of a participant to read only, use the fapt
command with the -read_only control argument to add the participant
again.  This will change the original access of the participant to read
only.

The  meeting  chairman  can  use  the convert_forum command to convert
meetings  created  with pre-MR11 software to current version meetings.
The  old version meeting is left untouched and should be deleted using
the  forum_delete  command.   To  avoid  deleting  the current version
meeting,  you  must  include  the  ".control" suffix at the end of the
meeting_name.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
