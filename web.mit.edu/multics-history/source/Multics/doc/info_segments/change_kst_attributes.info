03/13/84  change_kst_attributes

Syntax:  change_kst_attributes {-control_arg} target attributes


Function:  allows you to change selected per-process attributes of a
segment.


Arguments:
target
   specifies the segment whose known segment table (KST) attributes are
   to be changed.  Either a relative pathname or an octal segment
   number can be supplied.
attributes
   are per-process attributes of a segment.  See "List of attributes"
   below.


Control arguments:
-name, -nm
   is used only if the target is a relative pathname that looks like a
   segment number.


List of attributes:  One or more of the following must be given--
allow_deactivate
   if set, permits explicit deactivation of the segment.
allow_write
   if set, you are not prevented from writing into the segment or
   directory if you have permission to do so.
audit
   if set, enables auditing.
tms
   if set, date-time-modified is not updated on your user account.
tpd
   if set, pages of this object are not placed on the paging device on
   your account.
tus
   if set, date-time-used is not updated on your user account.


Notes on access required: This command requires access to the hphcs_
gate if the tms or tus attributes are to be set; otherwise, access to
the phcs_ gate is required.


Notes:  Because directories are activated when their segment numbers
are assigned, it is not possible to set meaningfully the tpd, tms, tus,
or allow_deactivate attributes for a directory.

If an attribute is preceded by the circumflex character (^), then the
attribute is reset; otherwise, the attribute is set.  Attributes not
mentioned are unaffected.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
