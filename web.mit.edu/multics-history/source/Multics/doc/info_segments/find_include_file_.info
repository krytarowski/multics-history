08/22/83  find_include_file_



The primary entry point of the find_include_file_ subroutine searches
for an include file on behalf of a translator.  If the include file is
found, additional information about the segment found is returned in
the parameters.  The "translator" search list is used to locate the
include file.


Entry points in find_include_file_:
   (List is generated by the help command)


:Entry:  initiate_count:  05/05/83 find_include_file_$initiate_count


Function:  This entry point is the interface presented to translators.
A translator calls this entry point to invoke a search for a single
include file segment using the "translator" search list.  For more
information about search lists, see the search facility commands, and
in particular the add_search_paths command in the Commands manual.


Syntax:
declare find_include_file_$initiate_count entry (char(*), ptr, char(*),
     fixed bin(24), ptr, fixed bin(35));
call find_include_file_$initiate_count (translator, referencing_ptr,
     file_name, bit_count, seg_ptr, code);


Arguments:
translator
   is the name of the translator that is calling this procedure (e.g.,
   pl1, alm).  (Input)
referencing_ptr
   is a pointer into the segment (normally a pointer to the source
   line) that caused the invocation of this instance of this procedure.
   (Input)
file_name
   is the complete entryname of the include file this procedure is to
   locate (e.g., xxx.incl.pl1).  (Input)
bit_count
   is the bit count as obtained from the storage system of the found
   include file.  (Output).  If an include file is not found, this
   parameter is set to 0.


seg_ptr
   is a pointer to the first character of the include file, if found;
   if not found, this parameter is set to the null pointer value.
   (Output)
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output).  The code can be:
   0
      the requested file was found normally.  All output parameters
      have been set normally.
   error_table_$zero_length_seg
      the requested file was found, but the bit count was zero.  All
      output parameters have been set normally.
   error_table_$noentry
      the requested file was not found in any of the search
      directories.
   other storage system error codes
      the requested file was not found because of some error.


Notes:
If this procedure finds an include file by a link, the seg_ptr
parameter correctly designates the actual location of the include file.
It is possible, however, that the name of the actual include file is
not the same as the file_name argument passed to this procedure.  It is
the responsibility of the translator to determine if the file_name
passed to this procedure is also on the include file actually found.
It is also the responsibility of the translator to call the
hcs_$terminate_noname entry point on the include file when processing
is complete.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
