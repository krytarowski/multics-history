10/31/85  list_tape_contents, ltc

Syntax:  ltc vol1 {-comment comment_string} ... volN {-comment comment_string}
	   {-attach_args} {-control_args}


Function: prints information about files recorded on 9-track magnetic
tape in either ANSI standard labeled or IBM standard labeled format.


Arguments:
vol(i) {-comment comment_string}
   specifies the name of the tape volume set to be listed.
   (See "Notes on Volume Selection" below for more information.).
-comment comment_string, -com comment_string
   displays comment_string on the operator's console when the
   volume_name immediately preceding -comment is mounted.
-attach_args 
   mtape_ attach control arguments.  (See "Notes on Attachment" below
   for more information.).


Control arguments:
-volume_type type, -vt type
   specifies the format type of volume set being processed.  The value
   of type may be "ibm" or "ansi".  When -volume_type is omitted the
   tape format type defaults to "ansi".
-brief, -bf   
   prints the identifier and sequence number of each file selected from
   the volume set. 
-long, -lg
   prints detailed information about each file selected from the volume set.
-from N
   starts output of information with file number N where 0 < N < 10000.  
-to N
   stops processing the volume set after file number N where 0 < N <10000.  


Notes on Volume Selection: 

When specifying the volume identifier, The -volume(-vol) control
argument must proceed any volume identifier which begins with a hyphen.

If the volume set to be listed was created on Multics, only the first
volume identifier of the volume set must be input.  The remainder of
the identifiers are retieved automatically from the volume set.

If the volume set to be listed was NOT created on Multics, each volume
identifer must be given.

Up to 64 volumes may be selected.


Notes on Volume Set Information:

The information printed by this command is extracted from the tape
labels and printed in various amounts according to the control
arguments supplied.  The information available for each level of
control is shown below.  Where information is not obtainable from the
label, the value "****" is printed as the item entry.


Information printed by list_tape_contents:

Id:         <file identifier>                   | -brief |	         |
Number:     <file sequence number>	        |	   -bf |	         |

Blksize:    <physical block size in characters>	       | (default) |
Lrecl:      <logical record length in characters>	       |	         |
Mode:       <encoding mode>			       |	         | -long
Created:    <file creation date>		       |	         |   -lg
Expires:    <file expiration date>		       |	         |     
Section:    <file set section number>			         |
Version:    <file generation version number>		         |
Generation: <file generation number>			         |



Notes on Attachment:

A complete attach description is created for processing the volume set.
It is composed of the string:

"mtape_ -volume_type ansi -no_display -density 1600 -track 9
        -error -device 1 -label -no_system -no_wait "

or

"mtape_ -volume_type ibm  -no_display -density 1600 -track 9 
        -error -device 1 -label -no_system -no_wait "

any mtape_ attach control arguments supplied to ltc are added to the
end of the attach description and passed to mtape_.


Notes on mtape_ argument defaults:

To avoid unexpected results, ltc supplies complete open, close and
detach descriptions to mtape_.  These arguments will override any
default values that may have been established by the mtape_set_defaults
command.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
