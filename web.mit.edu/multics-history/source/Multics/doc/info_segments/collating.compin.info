Syntax: .ifi collating  "copyright-year"
     OR .ifi coll_page  "copyright-year"
        .srv file_no    "Pubs-catalog-file-number"
        .srv add_letter "what-addendum"
        .srv add_date   "publish-date"
and at the top of the second page (to set the proper footers)
        .ifi coll_cont


Function:
When composed, this macro creates a collating page (or pages) for an
addendum to a manual.  It:
1) generates the heading, standard "remove and insert" sentence, and
   remove and insert column headings (see "Notes" below)
2) generates the proper footers for the first and succeeding pages


Arguments:
'copyright-year' is the copyright year (all 4 digits) for the addendum,
   not the manual.
'Pubs-catalog-file-number' is the file reference number given in the
   Publications Catalog.  (For Honeywell use, these numbers will be
   found in Table 1-3 in Part III, "Writing and Editing," of the
   Honeywell Publications Standards.)
'what-addendum' is a single capital letter, indicating which addendum
   this is (i.e., A is the first addendum; B, second; etc.).
'publish-date' is the month and year, in the form mm/yy, that this
   addendum is published (generally, "published" here means "brought to
   the printer").  Normally, leading zeros are not used, so a publish
   date of August 1978 would be 8/78 not 08/78.


Notes:
The column headings generated by this macro assume that the output of
the first column begins in character position 6 and the second column,
in character position 46.  Thus, the user's compin segment can easily
be done using the compose horizontal tab controls (see WORDPRO
Reference Guide, Section 4).


Examples:
The following compin segment

     .ifi init_mpm "AT58"
     .ifi collating "1978"
     .srv file_no "1L13"
     .srv add_letter "A"
     .srv add_date "8/78"
     .htd pages 6,46
     .htn > pages
     >iii through vii>iii through vii
     .spb
     >2-1 through 2-4>2-1, 2-2
     >>2-3, 2-3.1
     >>2-3.2, 2-4
     .spb
       .
       .
       .
     .htf >


produces the following compout

		    COLLATING INSTRUCTIONS

    To update the manual, remove old pages and insert new pages as
follows:

      Remove			      Insert

      iii through vii		      iii through vii

      2-1 through 2-4		      2-1, 2-2
				      2-3, 2-3.1
				      2-3.2, 2-4

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
