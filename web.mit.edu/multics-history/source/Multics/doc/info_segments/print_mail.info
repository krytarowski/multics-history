01/14/87  print_mail, prm

Syntax as a command:  prm {mbx_specification} {-control_args}


Function:  prints the messages in a mailbox, querying you whether to
delete each one after it is printed.


Arguments:
mbx_specification
   specifies the mailbox from which messages are to be printed.  If not
   given, the user's default mailbox
   (>udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.mbx) is used.


Control arguments:
-accessible, -acc
   selects only those messages in the mailbox that you are permitted to
   read.  If you have read (r) extended access on the mailbox,
   print_mail selects all messages in the mailbox; if you have own (o)
   extended access on the mailbox, it selects only those messages that
   you sent to the mailbox.  (Default)
-acknowledge, -ack
   acknowledges messages that request acknowledgement.  (Default)
-all, -a
   selects all messages in the mailbox regardless of who sent them.  It
   requires read (r) extended access on the mailbox.
-brief, -bf
   shortens the greeting message.  This message indicates the number of
   messages in the mailbox.
-brief_header, -bfhe
   displays the minimal amount of information from the message header.
   The date and authors are always displayed; the subject is displayed
   if it is not blank; the number of recipients is displayed either if
   there is more than one recipient or if you are not the sole
   recipient of the message; if the message is forwarded with comments,
   they are also displayed.
-count, -ct
   displays the number of messages read from the mailbox before
   printing the first message.  (Default)
-debug, -db
   enables print_mail's debugging facilities.  It is not recommended
   for normal users of print_mail.
-header, -he
   displays all information from the message header, including
   user-defined fields and excluding the message trace and redundant
   information.  (Default)
-interactive_messages, -im
   includes interactive messages (as sent by the send_message command)
   along with regular mail.  (Default)
-list, -ls
   prints a summary of all the messages before printing the first
   message.  This summary is identical to that produced by the
   read_mail list request.
-long, -lg
   prints the long form of the greeting message.  (Default)
-long_header, -lghe
   displays all information from the message header, including
   network-tracing information, even if some of it is redundant (e.g.,
   if the From, Sender, and Delivery-By fields are all equal,
   -long_header forces print_mail to display them when it prints the
   message).
-mail, -ml
   prints ordinary messages in the mailbox.  (Default)
-no_acknowledge, -nack
   does not acknowledge messages that request acknowledgement.
-no_count, -nct
   does not display the message count.
-no_debug, -ndb
   disables print_mail's debugging facilities.  (Default)
-no_header, -nhe
   displays no information from the message header.  Only the message
   number, message body line count, and message body are displayed.
-no_interactive_messages, -nim
   does not include interactive messages.  It is incompatible with
   -no_mail.
-no_list, -nls
   does not print a summary of the messages.  (Default)
-no_mail, -nml
   does not print ordinary messages.
-no_reverse, -nrv
   prints the messages in ascending numeric order.  (Default)
-not_own
   selects only those messages in the mailbox that were not sent by
   you.  It requires read (r) extended access on the mailbox.
-own
   selects only those messages in the mailbox that you sent to the
   mailbox.  It requires own (o) extended access on the mailbox.
-reverse, -rv
   prints the messages in descending numeric order.


List of mbx specifications:
-log
   specifies the user's logbox and is equivalent to

         -mailbox >udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.sv.mbx

-mailbox path, -mbx path
   specifies the pathname of a mailbox.  The suffix mbx is added if
   necessary.
-save path, -sv path
   specifies the pathname of a savebox.  The suffix sv.mbx is added if
   necessary.
-user STR
   specifies either a user's default mailbox or an entry in the system
   mail table (see "Notes on Mailbox Selection by User" below).
STR
   is any noncontrol argument and is first interpreted as -mailbox STR;
   if no mailbox is found, STR is then interpreted as -save STR; if no
   savebox is found, it is interpreted as -user STR.


List of query responses:  After printing each message, print_mail asks
the question

      print_mail: Delete #N?

The acceptable answers are
?
   prints the list of acceptable answers.
abort
   exits print_mail without deleting any messages.
no, n
   does not delete this message.
quit, q
   deletes the indicated messages and exits print_mail; the message
   just printed is not deleted (see "Notes").
reprint, print, pr, p
   prints the message and asks the question again.
yes, y
   deletes this message (see "Notes").


Notes:  Answering "yes" to the query after a message is printed does
not delete the message immediately but marks it as one for deletion.

Messages are actually deleted either after you answered the query for
the last message (unless you typed "abort") or after you answered any
query with "quit."


Notes on mailbox selection by user:  A user's default mailbox is
specified in the form Person_id.Project_id.  For an entry in the mail
table, STR is usually in the form of Person_id.  The mail table permits
you to address mail by Person_id without knowing the Project_id of the
recipient.  The mail table is described in the _E_x_t_e_n_d_e_d _M_a_i_l _S_y_s_t_e_m
_U_s_e_r_'_s _G_u_i_d_e (CH23) and the _M_u_l_t_i_c_s _S_y_s_t_e_m _A_d_m_i_n_i_s_t_r_a_t_i_o_n _P_r_o_c_e_d_u_r_e_s
(AK50) manuals.

If STR contains one period and no white space, it is interpreted as a
User_id that specifies a user's default mailbox; otherwise it is
interpreted as the name of an entry in the mail table.

For example,

      -user DBuxtehude.SiteSA

is interpreted as a User_id that identifies a default mailbox.  On the
other hand,

      -user "George G. Byron"
      -user L.v.Beethoven
      -user Burns

are all interpreted as the names of entries in the mail table:  the
first because it contains white space; the second because it contains
more than one period; the third because it contains no period.

When interpreted as a User_id, STR cannot contain any angle brackets
(<>) and must have the form Person_id.Project_id, where "Person_id"
cannot exceed 28 characters and "Project_id" 32 characters.  In this
case, "-user STR" is equivalent to the mbx_specification "-mailbox
>udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.mbx."

When interpreted as the name of a mail table entry, STR cannot contain
any commas, colons, semicolons, backslashes (\), parentheses, angle
brackets, braces ({}), quotes, commercial at-signs (@), or white space
other than spaces.  The query of the mail table is performed in a
case-insensitive manner.  Use the display_mailing_address command to
determine the actual address corresponding to STR.  The address in the
mail table must identify a mailbox.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
