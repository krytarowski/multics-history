menu_$create allows the creation of menus greater than the width
specified in the menu_format.max_width element.  However it only
allocates enough space for a menu of max_width size.  This creates
problems when text outside of the allocated space is referenced.

There is indeed a problem with the init documentation, interesting that
no one ever noticed it before.  There is no such thing as ft_menu_$init
or cb_menu_$init for that matter.

The ft_menu_$init help in the info file actually goes to init2 (Same
for cb_menu_$init).  The manual ft_menu_$init1 and 2 sections of the
manual are correct but subtle.  init2 follows init1 and under init2 it
says THESE MUST BE THE FIRST CALLS.  It might be better if init1 and
init2 are listed together without the horizontal bar separating them.

The cb_menu_$init1 section of the manual just leaves off init2.
However the rest of the section deals with init2 not init1.  init1 is
mentioned in the declarations section.

The format of these two sections for ft_menu_ and cb_menu_ should be
the same since they are doing the same thing.

When using the menu system on SUPERBRAIN (and other terminals), the
screen does not clear on exit.  This problem seems to happen on
terminals without line insert/delete functionality.

I have not been able to reproduce the problem.  I assume that a change
to the video system has fixed it.

The command interface cannot get rid of the *'d menu choice except by
doing another menu_display, because the menu object with record of the *
is discarded.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
