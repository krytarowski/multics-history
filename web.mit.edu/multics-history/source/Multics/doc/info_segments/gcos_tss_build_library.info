08/02/84  gcos_tss_build_library, gtbl

Syntax as a command:  gtbl input_libs {-control_args}


Function:  This command builds or updates the GCOS software library,
gtss_fast_library_, used by gcos_tss, and updates the program
descriptors required to access the added software.


Arguments:
input_libs
   are the pathnames of one or more GCOS software libraries.  The input
   libraries are either in native GCOS format (as copied from a GCOS
   total system tape) or in GCOS environment simulator format (as
   output from gcos_build_library).


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses printing of information concerning updated modules and
   program descriptors and the catalog, even if requested by the
   -print_catalog control argument.
-module_file path, -mf path
   path specifies the segment containing a list of modules to be moved
   from the input libraries to the output library.  These names are
   added to those specified by the -module control argument.
-modules STR1 {...STRn}, -mods STR1 {...STRn}
   STRi specifies the name of the module to be moved from an input
   library to the output library.  These names are added to those
   specified by the -module_file control argument.


-output_library path, -olb path
   specifies the path of the gtss_fast_library_ output library.  If the
   library already exists, it is appended to.
-print_catalog, -prcat
   prints the catalog (modules and offsets) of an input library if the
   library is in simulator format.
-program_descriptors path, -prgdes path
   path specifies the gtss program descriptors (a copy of
   gtss_prgdes_alm_.incl.alm) to be updated.


Notes:  If no output library path is specified, then only a list of the
modules found on the input libraries is printed.

To use the added modules in gtss, the -prgdes control argument must be
used.  Then gts_prgdes_ext_.alm must be reassembled with the
gtss_prgdes_alm_.incl.alm specified by -prgdes.  Following this, gtss
must be rebound with the new gtss_prgdes_ext_, and the updated output
library must be copied to gtss_fast_library_ in the directory
containing gtss (or a link established).

This is the only procedure required to add PSP or user software to the
gcos_tss library for which there are program descriptors.


If the -modules and -module_ file control arguments are not specified,
then all modules found on the input libraries are copied to the output
library.  The only exception is when the -prgdes control argument is
specified.  In this case, only modules on the input libraries, which
are actually needed by the program descriptor file, are copied.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
