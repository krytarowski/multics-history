03/08/82  monitor_quota

Syntax:  monitor_quota  {-control_args}


Function: calculates storage of a directory and will send a warning
message at the approach of a record quota overflow condition.


Control arguments: 
-call STR {N}
   specifies that STR is to be passed to the command processor as a
   command when a directory's segment quota used is found to be
   greater then 90 percent of the quota assigned.  If N is given then
   the default of 90 percent will be overridden.  (See Notes below.)
-console {N}
   sends a warning of an approaching record quota overflow condition
   to the system console.  Access to the phcs_ gate is required to
   issue warnings on the system console.  If N is specified then the
   default percent value at which the warning is to be issued will be
   overridden.
-off
   turns off all monitoring completely in this process.  This control
   argument must not be given with any other arguments.


-pathname, -pn
   specifies the pathname of the directory to be monitored. Only one 
   path may be given when invoked. The default is the user's working 
   directory.
-repeat DT, -rpt DT
   identifies the interval to set the monitor time to.  This argument
   will override the default time calculation.  The DT is a relative
   time >= 1 minute and acceptable to convert_date_to_binary_.
-print, -pr
   provides a list of directories being monitored and control
   information on the selected directories.
-warn User_ids {N}
   sends the warning message to the individual specified in
   User_id.  A limit of ten users may be listed with the
   use of this control argument.  The invoking user will be sent a
   message by default if this control argument and -console is
   omitted.  If N is specified then the default percent value at which
   the warning is to be issued will be overridden.


Notes: This command can be used several times in a process to monitor
several different directories.  Use of the -off control argument stops
monitoring of all directories.

The number of records given with the -call, -console and -warn {N}
control argument must be less then the quota assigned to the
directory.

The default interval when invoked without the -repeat control argument
will automatically be set with a time interval dependent on how much
available storage was found.  That is, if the directory was 50% full,
then an alarm would be set to trigger in 30 minutes to check again.
If the quota was found to be at 80% then a message would be sent and
an alarm time of 2 minutes would be set.  At 90% it would send a
warning every minute, and if -call has been provided, then the
specified string will be passed to the command processor.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
