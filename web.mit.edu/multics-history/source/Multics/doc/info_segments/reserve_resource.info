10/17/84  reserve_resource, rsr

Syntax as a command:  rsr -control_arg


Function:  reserves a resource or group of resources for use by the
calling process.  The reservation takes effect immediately and lasts
until canceled by cancel_resource or by process termination.  (See
Section 5 of the Programmer's Reference Manual for more information on
resource reservation.)


Control arguments:
-resource STR, -rsc STR
   specifies a description of the resources to be reserved.  If the
   description contains spaces or special characters, enclose it in
   quotes.  (See "Notes on resource description.")


Notes on resource description:  A resource description describes
certain devices and volumes by name or by attributes and an optional
number.  It has the following format:
   {-resource_type} resource_spec1...{-resource_type resource_specN}
which is a series of at least one resource_spec where all but the first
must be preceded by -resource_type (-rsct).


The format of a resource_spec can be any of the following--
   volume_type name1 {names}
   device_type {names}
   device_type {-control_args}
where:
volume_type
   can be either tape_vol or disk_vol.  You must supply at least one
   name with volume_type, and it is the name of the volume, for
   example, 050102.
device_type
   can be either tape_drive or disk_drive; "names" are the names of
   devices such as tape_01; if you select no names, you can choose from
   these control arguments:


   -attributes STR, -attr STR
      is a list where STR consists of a string of attributes with
      values separated by commas with no spaces.  For tape drives the
      attributes are:
         mode=
         track=
         den=
         speed=
   For disk drives the only attribute is model=.
   Use list_resource_types to find suitable values for these
   attributes.
   -number N, -nb N
      is the number of identical resources of the type desired.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
