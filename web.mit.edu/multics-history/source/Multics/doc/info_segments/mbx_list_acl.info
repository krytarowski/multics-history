Syntax as a command:  mbla path {User_ids} {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [mbla {User_ids}]


Function:  lists entries on the access control lists (ACLs) of
mailboxes.  (For a description of ACLs, see the Programmer's Reference
Manual.)


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a mailbox.  The mbx suffix is assumed.
User_ids
   are access control names of the form Person_id.Project_id.tag.  All
   entries with matching names are listed.  If you give no User_ids,
   the entire ACL is listed.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
