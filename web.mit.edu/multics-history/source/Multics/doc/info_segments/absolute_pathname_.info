:Entry: absolute_pathname_: 02/13/84  absolute_pathname_

Function: converts a relative or absolute pathname into a full
absolute pathname.  This entry does not accept the syntax for
specifying archive component pathnames; if one is supplied, an error
code is returned.


Syntax:
declare absolute_pathname_ entry (char(*), char(*), fixed bin (35));
call absolute_pathname_ (pathname, full_pathname, code);


Arguments:
pathname
   is the relative or absolute pathname to be expanded.  (Input)
full_pathname
   is the full, absolute pathname derived from the input pathname.
   (Output)
code
   is a standard system error code.  (Output) If an error has occurred,
   it can have one of the following values:
   error_table_$lesserr
      too many less-than ("<") characters in pathname.
   error_table_$badpath
      invalid syntax in pathname.


   error_table_$pathlong
      the expanded pathname is longer than 168 characters.
   error_table_$entlong
      the entryname portion of the expanded pathname is longer than 32
      characters.
   error_table_$archive_pathname
      the input pathname specified an archive component; this feature
      is only supported by the expand_pathname_$component and
      expand_pathname_$component_add_suffix entrypoints.
   error_table_$no_wdir
      a relative pathname is specified, but no working directory is in
      force for the process.


:Entry:  add_suffix:  02/13/84 absolute_pathname_$add_suffix


Function:  This entrypoint expands a relative or absolute pathname into
a full, absolute pathname, adding a suffix to the entryname if that
suffix is not already present.


Syntax:
declare absolute_pathname_$add_suffix entry (char(*), char(*), char(*),
     fixed bin (35));
call absolute_pathname_$add_suffix (pathname, suffix, full_pathname,
     code);


Arguments:
pathname
   is the relative or absolute pathname to be expanded.  (Input)
suffix
   is the suffix to be added to the entryname portion of the pathname.
   (Input) The period separating the entryname and the suffix must not
   be included.  If a null string is supplied, no suffix is added.
full_pathname
   is the full, absolute pathname derived from the input pathname.
   (Output)
code
   is a standard system error code.  (Output) It can have the same
   values described for absolute_pathname_.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
