Function:	 This describes, briefly, the builtin functions avaiable to MRDS
database users in evaluating selection expressions.


Builtin funtions:
abs (X)
   gives absolute value of X, X must be numeric.
after (S1 S2)
   returns portion of S1 after leftmost occurrence of S2, both string types.
before (S1 S2)
   returns portion of S1 before leftmost occurrence of S2, both string types.
ceil (X)
   returns smallest interger >= X, X must be real.
concat (S1 S2)
   returns the concatenation of strings S1 and S2.
floor (X)
   returns the largest integer <= X, X must be real.
index (S1 S2)
   returns position of leftmost occurence of S2 within S1, both string types.
mod (X Y)
   returns X modulo Y, X and Y must be real.
reverse (S)
   returns a string, which is the reverse of S, S must be string data type.
round (X Q)
   returns X rounded to Q fractional digits, X real, Q integer.
search (S1 S2)
   returns position in S1 of leftmost occurrence of any character in S2.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
