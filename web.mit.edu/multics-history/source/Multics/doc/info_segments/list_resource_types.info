02/15/85  list_resource_types, lrt

Syntax as a command:  lrt {type1...typeN} {-control_args}


Function: prints a list of all resource types described in a resource
type description table (RTDT).


Arguments:
type1
   is the resource type defined in the RTDT for which information is to
   be listed.  If you give no type, all known resource types are
   listed.


Control arguments:
-long, -lg
   lists the defined attributes for each resource type.
-no_header, -nhe
   omits the column headers.
-pathname path, -pn path
   lists resource types defined in the RTDT specified by path.  If you
   give no -pathname, the RTDT residing in >system_control_1 is used.


Notes: See also the list_resources command, which lists groups of
resources according to specified criteria.  For example, list_resources
can list all resources known by the Resource Control Package (RCP) or
those owned by a given user and/or project.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
