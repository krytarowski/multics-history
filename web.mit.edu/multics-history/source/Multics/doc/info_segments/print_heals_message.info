02/15/84  print_heals_message

Syntax:  print_heals_message {-control_args}


Function:  is a tool to be used by administrators for the maintenance
of the HEALS log (the segment named
>system_control_1>heals_dir>heals_log).  It allows the printing of all
or selected messages currently in the log.  It can also be used to
delete bad records from the log as well as to print out parts of each
logged record.


Control arguments:
-time DT
   selects all messages that occurred after the specified time.  If
   omitted, a value of 0 is assumed.
-update
   allows you to delete selected messages from the HEALS log if you
   have the appropriate access (see "Notes" below).
-match STR
   selects messages with text containing the match string.


Notes:  The date/time following -time must be of a form acceptable to
convert_date_to_binary_ (see the Subroutines manual).

This command opens the heals_log segment with a mode of
keyed_sequential_update to allow messages to be deleted.  If a message
is selected by using either -time or -match, you can issue the
following requests:
quit,q
   discontinues message processing and returns to command level.


next
   selects the next message that meets the specified selection
   requirements.
delete
   deletes the current record.
data
   prints the octal data contained in the current record.


Access required:  You must have rw access on
>system_control_1>heals_dir>heals_log for the update function;
otherwise, r access is sufficient.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
