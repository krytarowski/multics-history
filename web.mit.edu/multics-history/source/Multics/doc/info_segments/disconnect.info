08/05/87 disconnect

Syntax:  disconnect


Function: Disconnects the terminal from the current process, suspending
that process if the user's disconnect_ok process attribute is on.
If the trusted path login installation parm is off the terminal will
remain dialed to the system.  If the disconnect_ok process attribute is
on and the trusted path login installation parm is on then a message
will be displayed stating the line must be hung up followed by a
hangup.  If the disconnect_ok process attribute is off then an message
will be displayed stating the process cannot be suspended and no
further action will take place.


Notes: If disconnect is called from an absentee or daemon process an
error message will be returned without further action.


When the process is suspended after disconnection, it will remain that
way for a period of time equal to or less than the site-specified
inactivity time.  Contact your project administrator for process
attribute information.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
