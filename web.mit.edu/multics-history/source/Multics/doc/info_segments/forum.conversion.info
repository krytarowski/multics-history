The continuum subsystem has been renamed "forum".  Forum is completely
compatible with continuum except for changes in the names of the
commands and several of the requests, the method of notifications, and
the name of the search path used to locate meetings.

Before attempting to use the forum subsystem, you should create a "forum"
search path which is identical to your "continuum" search path. The Multics
command 

	set_search_paths forum [print_search_paths continuum]

will do this. If your start_up.ec changes the "continuum" search path, it 
should be modified to change the "forum" search path instead.


Once you have established a forum search path, use the
forum_list_meetings (flsm) command, formerly con_list_meetings or
meeting_list, to obtain information about available forums.  You may
want to compare the output of the forum_list_meetings and con_list_meetings
commands to make sure that you have not lost any meetings. The
con_meeting_dir command has been renamed "forum_dir (fd)".

To enter the forum subsystem, use the "forum" command.  subsystem.
Forum is compatible with continuum with only minor changes which
increase the usefullness of the subsystem.  The "con_meeting_dir"
request has been renamed "forum_dir" and the obsolete name_list request
has been deleted, you should use the list_users (lsu) request instead.


In an effort to decrease the cost of entering transactions,
notifications will only be sent to users who have explicitly requested
them by invoking the forum_accept_notifications (fant) command.  The
notify flag must still be set for each meeting for which you wish to
receive notifications.  To continue to receive notifications from the
same meetings you receive them for now, just add the
forum_accept_notifications command to your start_up.


The correspondence between forum and continuum commands is as follows:

	FORUM			  CONTINUUM

	forum			  continuum (con)
	forum_list_meetings (flsm)	  con_list_meetings (clsm)
	forum_list_users (flsu)	  con_list_users (clsu)
	forum_dir (fd)		  con_meeting_dir (cmd)
	forum_create (fcr)		  create_con_meeting (crcm)
	forum_delete (fdl)		  delete_con_meeting (dlcm)
	forum_add_participant (fapt)	  con_add_participant (capt)
	forum_remove_participant (frpt) con_remove_participant (crpt)
	forum_add_project (fapj)	  con_add_project (capj)
	forum_remove_project (frpj)	  con_remove_project (crpj)
	forum_make_public (fmp)	  con_make_public (cmp)
	forum_unmake_public (fump)	  con_unmake_public (cump)

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
