03/01/84  ms_list_acl, msla

Syntax:  msla path access_names


Function:  lists all or part of the access control list (ACL) of a
given queue message segment.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a queue.  The ms suffix is assumed.  The star
   convention is allowed.
access_names
   are access control names of the form Person_id.Project_id.tag.  If
   all three components are present, the ACL entry with that name is
   listed.  If one or more components is missing, all ACL entries with
   matching names are listed.  (The matching strategy is described
   under "Notes" below.)  If no access control name is specified, or
   if the access control name is -all or -a, the entire ACL is listed.


Notes: The matching strategy for access control names is--

o  A literal component name, including "*", matches only a component of
   the same name.
o  A missing component name not delimited by a period is taken to
   be a literal "*" (e.g., "*.Multics" is treated as "*.Multics.*").
o  Missing components on the left must be delimited by periods.
o  A missing component name delimited by a period matches any component
   name.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
