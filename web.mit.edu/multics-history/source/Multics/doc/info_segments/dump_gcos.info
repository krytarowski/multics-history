09/12/74  dump_gcos, dgc

Syntax:  dgc pathname {octal_offset} -bcd (-ch) -line_length (-ll) n


Function: dumps a GCOS standard system format file, doing less printing than
dump_segment or dump_segment -bcd.


Notes: If octal offset is omitted, it defaults to zero. If it is given, it is
rounded DOWN to the beginning of the 320 (decimal) word block in which it
falls. Dumping always begins on a 320-word boundary.
  Dumping proceeds until the user QUIT's, or until an end of file (octal 17) is
found (in which case the user will be given the choice of quitting or
continuing); or until a block control word of all zeros is found, which always
terminates the dump.
  If -bcd (or -ch) is given, the contents of BCD and ASCII records are printed
(the BCD being converted to ASCII for printing), preceeded by the rcw and its
offset. For binary card records, the offset and rcw, and the words BINARY CARD
are printed.
  If -bcd is not given, just bcw and rcws (and their offsets) are printed.
  The -line_length (-ll) n argument may be used to control the number of rcws
placed on each line. The default is 80, which is room for 4 rcws and their
offsets. Once set, the line length is remembered in internal static for the
remainder of the process.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
