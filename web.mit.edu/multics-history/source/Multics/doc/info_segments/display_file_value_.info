:Entry: display_file_value_: 02/01/83  display_file_value_


Function: outputs information about a file on a user-supplied switch.


Syntax:
dcl display_file_value_ entry (ptr, file, fixed bin (35));
call display_file_value_ (switch, a_file, code);


Arguments:
switch
   is a pointer to the iocb of the switch on which output is to be
   written.  If it is null, then iox_$user_output is used.  (Input)
a_file
   is the file, variable, or constant whose value is to be displayed.
   (Input)
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output)


Notes:
The output produced is, first, the values of the two pointers that
comprise a file.  If the file is closed, then a note to that effect is
produced, and the values of the file attribute block are given, and
that is all.

For all open files, the file name, address of its iocb, and pathname
are given.  If the file is neither stream nor record type, or if it is
both, then a note to the effect that the fsb is inconsistent is given.
Attributes relevant to the type of file (stream or record) are given.
For stream input files, the current input buffer is printed, with a
circumflex above the next character that is to be parsed.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
