10/20/86  trim_wordlist, twl

Syntax as a command:  twl path {dict_paths} {-control_args}


Function:  trims (deletes) all words in the specified wordlist segment
or MSF that are found in one or more Wordpro dictionaries.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the wordlist segment or MSF to be trimmed.  If
   path does not have the suffix wl, one is assumed; however, wl must
   be the last component of the segment name.
dict_paths
   are the pathnames of dictionaries to be searched in order.  If
   dict_paths does not have a suffix of dict, one is assumed; however,
   dict must be the last component of the dictionary segment name.  If
   no dict_paths are specified, the dictionaries in the dict search
   list are used.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the display of the number of words trimmed and the number
   of words remaining in the trimmed wordlist segment.
-exact_match, -exm
   trims only those words that match exactly a word found in a
   dictionary, i.e., no special processing is performed with respect to
   capitalization (see "Notes" below).
-temp_dir path, -td path
   path holds the temporary segment if the input file is an MSF.
   (Default is the process directory.)


Notes:  For each word processed, the dictionaries are searched in the
order specified or as defined in the dict search list.  Normally, when
a word is found in a dictionary, it is trimmed.  However, if the word
found has the no-trim attribute, then the word is not trimmed and no
more dictionaries are searched for this word.


When searching for a word in a dictionary, special processing of
capital letters is performed unless the -exact_match control argument
is specified.


Most words in a dictionary consist of all lowercase letters.  These
words match any representations of themselves that are either all
lowercase letters, all lowercase letters with a leading capital letter,
or all capital letters.


Words in a dictionary that have a leading capital letter only match
representations of themselves that have a leading capital letter or are
all capital letters.


Words in a dictionary that consist of all capital letters or mixed
lowercase and capital letters only match representations of themselves
that have the identical capitalization.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
