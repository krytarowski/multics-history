06/25/76  Access Isolation Mechanism (AIM)

A new access control mechanism known as the Access Isolation mechanism has
been added to Multics. This mechanism provides system-wide administrative
control over the access of processes to segments and directories, and over the
propagation of access.
  This document briefly describes the purpose and general concepts of this
mechanism.
  The current Multics access controls provide (1) rings to protect the
operating system from the actions of users, and (2) access control lists to
allow users, at their discretion, to grant or deny other users access to
segments and directories. The access isolation mechanism satisfies a need for
system-wide administrative control over the access of processes to segments and
directories.
  Under the access isolation mechanism, each object in the system
(segments, directories, messages in message segments) has an
access class. Each process has an access authorization, determined at login
time from login options, and from maximum authorizations assigned to each
person (e.g., Jones), project (e.g., SUNSPOTS), user ID (e.g.,
Jones.SUNSPOTS), and terminal channel. A process may read (or execute or
search) an object if the process' authorization is greater than or equal to the
object's access class. A process may write (or modify or append to) an object
only if the process' authorization is equal to the object's access class.
Future help files will detail the rules for determining effective access when
using the access isolation mechanism.
  Access control lists and ring brackets will continue to operate as before.
The major visible change is that a process' effective access to an object will
be the maximum access given by the ACL, ring brackets, and access class of the
object, taken all together. Within the set of objects and processes having
identical access classes and authorizations, ACL's still provide access control
at the individual user's discretion.
  Defaults have been designed so that the access isolation mechanism will be
invisible to users and projects not wishing to use it.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
