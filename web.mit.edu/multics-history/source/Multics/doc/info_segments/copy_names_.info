11/03/80  copy_names_

Syntax: 
dcl copy_names_ ext entry (char(*),char(*),char(*),char(*),
	      char(*),bit(1) aligned,fixed bin(35));
call copy_names_ (dir1, en1, dir2, en2, caller, errsw, code);


Function: This subroutine copies all the names from one entry to another.
Name duplications are handled by nd_handler_.


Arguments: 
dir1     the directory in which the original segment is found. (Input)
en1      a name on the original segment. (Input)
dir2     the target segment's directory. (Input)
en2      a name already on the target segment. (Input)
caller   the name of the calling procedure; it is used in calls to
         nd_handler_. (Input)
errsw    indicates which segment the error indicated by "code" occurred 
         on; it is set to "0"b if the error was on the original segment 
         and to "1"b if on the target. (Output)
code     a standard File System status code. (Output)


Notes: If name duplication occurs due to another entry having the
same name as the entry being copied, the status code
error_table_$namedup is returned.  Otherwise, if name duplication
occurs due to a name being copied, the code error_table_$segnamedup
is returned.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
