02/13/89        Errata Information for MR 12.2


pg 25-13 under "DETAILED BINARY  DATA FORMAT FOR FILE SYSTEM
     OBJECTS" in the description  of <branch_switches> delete the
     sentence "(Note  that the "audit"  switch has no  meaning in
     MR11)".

pg 25-17 under "SYSERR LOG  AUDIT SELECTIVITY"  change the
     reference from  "two levels" of audit  selectivity to "three
     levels," the third level being "file system object level."


pg 25-36 Add the following description:

                 FILE SYSTEM OBJECT AUDIT FLAGS
     A  file  system  object  audit  flag,  known  as  the "audit
     switch", is  associated with each entry in  the file system.
     The  setting of  this switch   can only  be modified  by the
     system security  administrator.  If this switch  is on, then
     all   accesses  of   the  segment,   either  successful   or
     unsuccessful,  are audited.   In the  case of  mailboxes and
     message   segments,   audit   messages   are   produced  for
     segment-level accesses (e.g.,  opening, deleting, reading or
     changing ACLs,  reading or changing attributes)  but not for
     message-level   accesses  (adding,  deleting,   reading,  or
     updating messages).


pg B-10  under "DETAILED OPERATION FIELD  OF STANDARD BINARY
     HEADER" add:   dcl FS_OBJ_AUDIT_FLAG_MOD fixed bin  (18) uns
     init (37) static options (constant):


pg B-12 under "FILE SYSTEM DETAILED OPERATION CODES" add:
     FS_OBJ_AUDIT_FLAG_MOD (fs_obj_status_mod)
          appears upon an  attempt to change the audit  switch of a
          file system entry.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
