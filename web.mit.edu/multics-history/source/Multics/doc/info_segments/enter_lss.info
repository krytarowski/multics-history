01/27/84  enter_lss

Syntax:  enter_lss path


Function:  causes the command processor to compare each command to a
supplied Limited Service Subsystem (LSS) control segment, which was
created using the make_commands command.  Any command not found in the
control segment is refused.  Those found are mapped into the command
specified by the control segment.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the LSS control segment.


Notes:  The LSS control segment must be previously created with the
make_commands command.  The command line as shown in the example above
is usually included in the project_start_up.ec.  See the make_commands
command, and Section 7 of the MAM -- Project Administrator
Manual, Order No.  AK51 for more details on the LSS facility and the
use of the project_start_up exec_com.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
