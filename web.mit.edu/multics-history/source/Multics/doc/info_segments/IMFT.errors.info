Description

0022  phx16848
If an error occurs reading the acknowledgement of a "pull" request,
the request is deferred, and therefore resubmitted later.  Meanwhile,
the foreign site has actrually succeeded in queueing the request, so
the file ultimately gets transferred twice.

0021  phx15250
 If a pull request is successfully queued, but then the output driver
 on the source site finds an access problem, the user is not notified
 on the target (i.e.  originating) system.  Fixing this probably means
 always sending a message to the target site whenever a request is
 rejected by the driver, no matter where the request originated.

0016  phx15007
 When the input driver terminates reception of an object at the
 operator's request (ie:  QUIT/release), it should inform the remote
 system's output driver.  Otherwise, the remote system will continue
 to transmit the object; the input driver, however, will ignore all
 data and control records until the BOF record that indicates the
 start of the next object.  As a result, the output driver will
 believe that the object was successfully transmitted when, in fact,
 it was thrown into the bit-bucket.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
