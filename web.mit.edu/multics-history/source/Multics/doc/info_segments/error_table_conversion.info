The official source language for error tables  is  changing  from
error_table_compiler  language  to alm, with special macros.  The
error_table_compiler will be removed from the system eventually.
Two  macros,  defined  in  et_macros.incl.alm,   are   used   for
constructing error tables:
     et        name_of_error_table
     ec        code_name,{short_message},(long message)

et initializes the error table.
The official source language for error tables  is  changing  from
error_table_compiler
If there is more than one code_name, they must  be  separated  by
commas and the list enclosed in parentheses.
short_message must be 8 characters or less.  If it is omitted, it
will be set to code_name.
Now that the source is in alm, the alm rules  for  blanks  apply.
In particular, blanks are treated as field delimiters.

To convert existing error tables to the new format, type:
          ec >t>convert_table name_of_error_table
This creates an alm source segment.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
