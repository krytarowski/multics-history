03/04/85  dl_handler_


This subroutine has three entry points that issue queries for each of
three situations involving deletion.  These situations are:

     Deletion of an entry whose safety switch or copy switch is on.
     Deletion via a starname that matches all entries, e.g. "**".
     Deletion of a directory (delete_dir always queries).

This subroutine returns a status code depending on the user's answer.
If the user answers "yes", all three entry points turn off the safety
and copy switches, and in the case of a directory, set sma to the user
before returning.


Entry points in dl_handler_:
   (List is generated by the help command)


:Entry: dl_handler_:  03/04/85  dl_handler_


Function:
The dl_handler_ entry point, called when an entry has its safety switch
or copy switch on, issues a query of the form:

        <caller>:  <path> is protected.  Do you want to delete it?

If the user answers yes, dl_handler_ turns off both switches and
returns a zero status code.


Syntax:
dcl dl_handler_ entry (char(*), char(*), char(*), fixed bin(35));
call dl_handler_ (caller, dn, en, code);


Arguments:
caller
   is the name of the calling program, used to print the query.
   (Input)
dn
   is the directory name.  (Input)
en
   is the entry name.  (Input)
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output) It can be:
   0  the user answered yes, switches have been turned off, and the
      entry can now be deleted.
   error_table_$action_not_performed
      the user answered no.
   other codes
      the switches could not be turned off.


The two other entry points have the same calling sequence as
dl_handler_.


:Entry:  dblstar:  03/04/85 dl_handler_$dblstar


Function:  This entry point issues the query:

        Do you want to '<caller> <en>' in <dn>?

where caller, the name of the calling program, is assumed to be a
suitable verb.  This entry point is called, for example, by the delete
and unlink commands, which also pass a double starname as the value of
en:

        Do you want to 'delete **' in <dir_path>?
        Do you want to 'unlink **' in <dir_path>?



:Entry:  dirdelete:  03/04/85 dl_handler_$dirdelete


Function:  This entry point assumes it is given a directory pathname,
and issues the query:

        <caller>:  Do you want to delete the directory dn>en?

This entry point is called, for example, by the delete_dir command.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
