Description

163  
When a buffer exceeds 99999 lines, "x" gets a size condition.

162  
"vd/xxx/" which deletes the last line of the buffer leaves "."
undefined, unlike ted_3.0y.

134  phx16876
"g*/./ P" prints null lines.  

120  phx15889
Given a regular expression of the form /aa.*xyz.*ttl/ the matching does
not give what people think it should because of the way it is
implemented.  People seem to expect that if the "xyz" is found and then
no "ttl" can be, that the search would back up and look for another
"xyz".  This is not the case.  If a search fails, it always goes back
to the beginning of the expression, moves ahead 1 character in the
string being searched and tries again.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
