05/31/83  Mailing lists

A mailing list is an ASCII segment or archive component which contains
one or more addresses.  When mail is sent to a mailing list, it is
delivered to each of the addresses in the list.  The members of a
mailing list may themselves be other mailing lists.  Although a mailing
list is composed of multiple addresses, all mail system operations
treat it as a single address.


Format of a mailing list:
A segment or archive component must have the suffix "mls" in order to
be used as a mailing list.  

The mailing list segment or archive component contains the printed
representations of its member addresses.  For a description of the
acceptable printed representations of an address, type:
     help addresses.gi -section printed representations

If multiple addresses are given on a single line in the mailing list,
they must be separated by commas; however, the comma at the end of a
line is optional.  The last line of the mailing list must not end with
a comma.


Example:
The following is a valid mailing list:

     Palter.Multics, Sibert.Multics,
     {save >udd>SiteSA>PKelley>PKelley.mlsys>outgoing},
     Mail-Enthusiasts at MIT-MC


Command/request line format:
The following control argument is used on a command/request line to
specify a mailing list address:

-mailing_list path,
-mls path
   specifies the pathname of a mailing list.  The suffix "mls" is added
   if necessary.  The archive component pathname convention is accepted.


Message header format:
The following text is used in message headers to represent a mailing
list address:

{list path}
   identifies a mailing list by pathname.  Path is the absolute
   pathname of the mailing list segment or archive component excluding
   the suffix "mls".

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
