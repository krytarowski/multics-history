02/13/85  link, lk

Syntax as a command:  lk path1 {path2...path1N path2N} {-control_args}


Function: creates a storage system link with a specified name in a
specified directory pointing to a specified segment, directory, or link
(for a discussion of links, see the Programmer's Reference Manual).


Arguments:
path1
   specifies the pathname of the storage system entry to which path2N
   is to point.  The star convention is allowed.  Give the pathnames in
   pairs.
path2
   specifies the pathname of the link to be created.  If omitted (in
   the final argument position of a command line only), a link to path1
   is created in your working directory with the entryname portion of
   path1N as its entryname.  The equal convention is allowed.


Control arguments:
-chase
   creates a link to the ultimate target of path1 if path1 is a link.
   The default is to create a link to path1 itself.
-no_chase
   creates a link directly to the target specified.  (Default)
-check, -ck
   refuses to create a link if the target does not exist or if its
   existence cannot be determined due to access.
-no_check, -nck
   creates a link whether or not the target exists.  (Default)
-copy_names, -cpnm
   copies the names of the target to the link after creating it.


-no_copy_names, -ncpnm
   does not copy the names of the target.  (Default)
-name STR, -nm STR
   specifies an entryname STR (either as a path1 or a path2, depending
   on position) that begins with a minus to distinguish it from a
   control argument.


Access required: You must have append permission for the directory in
which the link is to be created.


Notes: Entrynames must be unique within the directory.  If the
creation of a specified link introduces a duplication of names within
the directory and if the old entry has only one name, you are asked
whether to delete the entry with the old name.  If you answer "no", the
link is not created.  If the old entry has multiple names, the
conflicting name is removed and a message is issued to you.  In either
case since the directory in which the link is to be created is being
changed, you must have modify permission for that directory.

See the create_dir and create commands for the creation of directories
and segments.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
