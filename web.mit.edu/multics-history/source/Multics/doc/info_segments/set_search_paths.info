07/08/80	set_search_paths, ssp

Syntax:  ssp search_list {search_paths} {-control_arg}


Function:	 allows a user to replace the search paths contained in a
specified search list.


Arguments:
search_list
   is the name of a search list.  If this search list does not exist,
   it is created.  A warning message is printed if a search list is
   created and it is not system defined.
search_paths
   are search paths to be added to the specified search list.  The
   search paths are added in the order in which they are specified in
   the command line.  The search path can be an absolute or relative
   pathname or a keyword.  (For a list of acceptable keywords see
   add_search_paths in Commands and Active Functions, AG92.)  If no
   search paths are specified, then the specified search list is set
   as if it were being initialized for the first time in the user's
   process.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses a warning message for the creation of a search list not
   defined by the system.
-default, -df
   replaces the search list with its system-defined default.  No
   search_paths can be specified with this control argument.


Notes:  The specified search list is replaced by the specified search
paths.  It is an error to create a new empty search list.


For a complete list of the search facility commands, see the
add_search_paths command description in Commands and Active Functions,
AG92.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
