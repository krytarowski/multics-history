02/01/84  display_ioi_data

Syntax:  display_ioi_data {-control_args}


Function: displays control blocks in the ring-0 database ioi_data.  It
can be used on a running system, an fdump, or a copy of ioi_data made
with the copy_out command (see the System Dump Analysis PLM, Order
No. AN53).


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   causes all the channel table entries and device table entries
   associated with the group(s) selected to be displayed.  It can be
   used with -group or -gte.
-force, -fc
   forces the display of certain control block and/or fields that the
   command might not otherwise display.
-header, -he
   causes the ioi_data header to be displayed.  This is the default if
   no control blocks are selected.
-no_header, -nhe
   suppresses the display of the ioi_header.  This is the default when
   a control block is selected.


Control arguments for selecting: The following select where ioi_data is
   to be found.  Only one control argument can be selected from this
   list.  If none are specified, ioi_data is copied from ring-0 of the
   running system.
-erf erfno
   specifies the number of the fdump to be analyzed.
-segment path, -sm path
   specifies the pathname of the segment containing ioi_data.
   Normally, this segment is obtained from the running system using the
   copy_out command or from an fdump using the extract command.


Control arguments for displaying: The following specify which control
   blocks in ioi_data are to be displayed.  Only one control argument
   can be selected from the following list.  If none are specified,
   all control blocks are displayed.
-channel {channel_name}, -chn {channel_name}
   displays the channel table entry (cte) for the channel specified.
   If channel name is ommitted, all cte's are displayed.  The channel
   name argument is in the form {tag}number, where tag is an IOM tag
   (a thru h) and number is an octal channel number.  If tag is
   omitted, IOM a is assumed.
-cte {octal_offset}
   displays the cte at iom_data|octal_offset.  If offset is omitted,
   all cte's are displayed.


-device {device_name}, -dv {device_name}
   displays the device table entry (dte) for the device specified.  If
   device_name is omitted, all dte's are displayed.
-dte {octal_offset}
   displays the dte at iom_data|octal_offset.  If offset is omitted,
   all dte's are displayed.
-group {device_name}, -gp {device_name}
   displays the group table entry (gte) for the device specified.  If
   device_name is omitted, all gte's are displayed.
-gte {octal_offset}
   displays the gte at iom_data|octal_offset.  If offset is omitted,
   all gte's are displayed.
-user {Person_id.Project_id}
   displays the dte's of all devices assigned to the specified user.
   If Person_id.Project_id is omitted, your Person_id is assumed.
   Either Person_id or Project_id can be omitted or an asterisk (*)
   can be used in their place.


Access required: To use this command on a running system, access to the
phcs_ gate is required.


Notes: The default action of this command when invoked with no
arguments is:

   display_ioi_data -group -all -header

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
