02/01/84  bill

Syntax:  bill function {args}


Function: allows the accounting administrator to call the biller.ec
segment (in the directory >udd>SysAdmin>lib) to perform billing
operations.  See MAM - Registration and Accounting (AS68) for
detailed information.


List of functions:
prepare
   prepares the billing data bases for billing.
run MM DD YY arg
   runs the billing programs on the date specified in the form
      month day year
   arg is either an argument accepted by a command called to punch
   cards or is an argument accepted by the site-dependent program
   that produces billing output in the desired format.  The arg
   argument should not be supplied unless directed to by the system
   administrator.


accept arg
   prints the bills, cleans up the old billing data bases, and
   creates new one.  arg can be the name of a month, a Julian date, or
   any name that uniquely identifies the billing run.  If errors are
   detected in the bill, the "bill accept" command should NOT be
   invoked.  Instead, contact the system administrator immediately.
delete
   deletes the current months bills from the storage system.


Access required:  The billing programs and exec_coms set the required
access to all segments needed in order to run bills, but ONLY for
users registered on the SysAdmin project.  It is expected that the
person running bills will be logged in on this project.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
