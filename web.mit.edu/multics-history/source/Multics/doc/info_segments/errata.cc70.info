          Errata Information for MR12.3


pg 1-1:  after the description of "Directories" add the
     following.

         Archives

         Archives are segments that contain other segments
         (called components).  Archives are frequently used to
         store and manipulate groups of related segments.


pg 1-2 to 1-3:  to the description of "pathnames" add the
     following.

         If the final entryname of a path has a double colon in
         it, then the pathname is an archive component pathname.
         That part of the final entryname that is before the
         double colon is the name of an archive segment.  That
         portion of the entryname that follows the double colon
         is used to identify the individual archive segment.


pg 3-1 to 3-2:  change all references of "source segment" to
     "source program".

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
