:Info: library_dir_dir.gi: ldd.gi: 02/24/82 library_dir_dir (ldd)

     The starting directory of the subtree in which the source and
object of the system are stored.


:Info: limited_service_system.gi: 02/24/82 limited service system

     A subset of the Multics system imposed on users by the project
administrator.


:Info: link_pair.gi: 02/24/82 link pair

     An indirect word in a procedure segment's linkage section through
which all references to some external data or procedure are made.
Until the link is snapped (i.e., connected), it contains symbolic
information about the external object.  A link pair initially contains
a code that causes a fault, and invokes the dynamic linker, when first
used in a process.  The linking, if successful, puts the actual
address of the procedure or data referenced in the link pair.


:Info: linkage_section.gi: 02/24/82 linkage section

     The portion of a procedure object segment that is a pure template
for impure data needed by the procedure at runtime.  The phrase also
refers to the impure copy made from this template.  See also
dynamic_linking.info.


:Info: listener.gi: 02/25/82 listener

     The program that reads command lines from the terminal and passes
them to the command processor.


:Info: logical_volume.gi: 02/25/82 logical volume

     A set of physical volumes that are always mounted together.
For more detailed information, see logical_volumes.gi.info and
lv_attaching.gi.info.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
