09/08/88   mowse, MOWSE

Syntax as a command:   MOWSE {/control_args}


Function:
Invokes MOWSE on the PC and sets up the PC for communications. The
user can now invoke WSTERM to communicate with Multics with the PC
acting as a terminal. To run software on Multics and/or the PC that
uses the WS subroutine library, the user must subsequently invoke
MOWSE on Multics (see the attach_mowse command for Multics).

Any argument values specified on the command line will override any
conflicting specifications included in the file specified with the /F
option.  In addition, the first specification of an argument value
overrides any subsequent specification for the same parameter.  In
the case of using /L to load applications, ALL the applications
specified are loaded, whether they are specified on the command line,
or in the file used with /F.


Control arguments (communication):
/B BAUD
   This is the baud rate for the specific line that you are using.
   This may be from 110 bps to 9600 bps.  (DEFAULT -- 9600).

/P PARITY
   This is a one letter indication of Parity.
     E - Even (DEFAULT)
     O - Odd
     M - Mark
     S - Space
     N - None


/S STOP_BITS
   This is a one integer specification of the number of stop bits
   in each byte of data coming over the line.
     1 - One stop bit/byte (DEFAULT)
     2 - Two stop bits/byte

/D DATA_BITS
   This is a one integer specification of the number of Data bits in
   each byte of data coming over the line.
     7 - Seven data bits/byte (DEFAULT)
     8 - Eight data bits/byte


/H
   Hold communications line.  This specifies that MOWSE is to
   maintain an existing connection on the communications port.  If
   this option is NOT specified, then MOWSE will drop Data Terminal
   Ready (DTR) and Clear To Send (CTS) long enough that the
   connection to the communications port connection is broken.

/C COMM_PORT
   The communications port (COM1 and COM2) number provides the user
   (applications) with a means of specifying which communication port
   is to be used by MOWSE.
     1 - COM1 port (DEFAULT)
     2 - COM2 port


Control arguments (startup files):

/F FILE
   Specifies the PC file which is to be analyzed by MOWSE at
   startup.  This file (created by the user) contains parameter
   options which would normally be specified in the MOWSE command
   line.  Any of the options may be specified, except /F itself.
   (DEFAULT -- MOWSE.INI)

/L CAPABIL
   Specifies that CAPABIL is to be loaded as an application at
   the time MOWSE is started up.  CAPABIL is the name of the
   application to be loaded.  You may load more than one
   application at a time, but the name of each application must
   be preceeded by /L.


Control arguments (interrupt vectors):

/I USER_INTERRUPT_NUMBER
   Specifies that interrupt USER_INTERRUPT_NUMBER is to be used by
   application programs to make runtime requests of MOWSE.  This
   allows the user to force MOWSE into using an interrupt number
   which, to his knowledge, will not be used by other non-MOWSE
   applications.  Acceptable values are between 97 and 101 inclusive.
   (DEFAULT -- 97)


Control arguments (network compatability):

/E CHAR
   Specifies that the CHAR character (given as an octal value) is to
   be escaped when transmitted to the PC.

/N
   Specifies that a network will be used to connect to Multics.
   This has the effect of forcing end of packet (EOP) characters
   to be <CR>.  The use of this should be reserved to networks
   which require the <CR> as the forwarding character as opposed
   to the <LF> character.  This control_arg must be used in
   conjunction with attach_mowse -network control_arg.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
