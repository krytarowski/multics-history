4/4/85  forum_list_meetings, flsm

Syntax as a command:  flsm {meeting_names} {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [flsm {-control_args}]


Function:  prints a list of selected meetings on the user's terminal.
For each meeting selected, information about the names of the meeting
and per-user meeting attributes are listed.


Arguments:
meeting_names
   are optional meeting_names.  If any are supplied, information about
   only the specified meeting_names is printed.  The star convention is
   supported for meeting_names.  If no meeting_names are given,
   information for all meetings found in the forum search path is
   printed.


Control arguments:
-absolute_pathname, -absp
   prints the absolute pathname of a meeting.  The default lists the
   long and short meeting names only.
-adjourned, -adj
   selects information about meetings that have been adjourned.
-all, -a
   prints information about all meetings.  The default prints
   information about the meetings in which the user is eligible to
   participate only.
-before DATE_TIME, -be DATE_TIME
   selects meetings which have not changed since the specified time.
   DATE_TIME is any string acceptable to the convert_date_to_binary_
   subroutine.


-brief, -bf
   suppresses the message "No meetings have changed" which is printed
   by default if the -changes control argument is used and no meetings
   have changed.
-chairman {Person_id}, -cm {Person_id}
   prints information about meetings of which Person_id is chairman.
   If Person_id is not given, the user's Person_id is used.
-changed, -chg
   prints information about meetings in which the user is a participant
   and new transactions have been entered.
-count, -ct
   prints out the number of new transactions for a meeting in which the
   user is participating.  This control argument cannot be used if
   forum_list is invoked as an active function.
-eligible, -elig
   prints information about all meetings in which the user is eligible
   to participate.  (Default)


-exclude meeting_names, -ex meeting_names
   excludes the meetings identified by meeting_names from the output
   list.  This control argument is designed to be used when a starname
   has been supplied as meeting_names in order to exclude the specified
   meetings from being selected.  The default (-include) is to select
   all meetings that match the specified starname.
-from DT, -fm DT
   selects meetings which have changed since the specified time.  DT is
   any string acceptable to the convert_date_to_binary_ subroutine.
   The default is the current time.

   prints the meeting header.  This is the default, unless the -changes
   control argument was supplied.


-include meeting_names, -incl meeting_names
   includes the meetings identified by meeting_names in the output
   list.  This control argument is intended to be used when a starname
   has been specified for selecting meetings.  (Default)
-inhibit_error, -ihe
   does not print warning messages for such as things as bad meeting
   format and errors encountered while searching for meetings.
   (Default)
-long, -lg
   prints the message "No meetings have changed" if the -changes
   control argument is used and no meetings in which the user is a
   participant have changed.  (Default)
-no_changes, -nchg
   does not list changed meetings.


-no_adjourned, -nadj
   does not list adjourned meetings.
-no_header, -nhe
   suppresses printing of the meeting header.
-no_inhibit_error, -nihe
   prints all warning messages.
-no_notify, -nnt
   does not list meetings in which the user has the notify flag set.
-no_participating, -npart
   does not list meetings in which the user is a participant.
-no_read_only, -nro
   does not list meetings to which the user has only read access.
-notify, -nt
   lists only meetings in which the user has the notify flag set.


-participating, -part
   lists only meetings in which the user is participating.  The default
   prints information about all meetings that the user is eligible to
   participate in.
-read_only, -ro
   lists just the meetings to which the user has only read access.
-user User_id
   determines participation, eligibility, and changes attributes for
   the user specified by User_id.  User_id is in the form
   Person_id.Project_id.tag, where any of the components can be the
   character "*".  If a component is omitted, it is assumed to be "*".
-verbose, -vb
   prints the chairman's User_id and current and last transactions for
   each meeting.  This control argument cannot be used with the
   -changes control argument or when invoking flsm as an active
   function.


Notes on flags:  The output from this command may include flags that
have the following interpretation:

     a    attending flag
          the user is currently attending the meeting

     c    change flag
          new transactions have been entered in the proceedings of the
          meeting since the user last attended this meeting.

     e    eligible flag
          the user can participate in the meeting.

     j    adjourned flag
          the chairman has temporarily adjourned the meeting.

     n    notify flag
          the user has turned on the notify flag in the meeting (i.e.,
          the user has requested online notification when new
          transactions are entered in the meeting).

     o    observer flag
          the user has only read access to the meeting.

     p    participant flag
          the user is a participant in meeting (i.e., has gone to the
          meeting at least once).

     r    removed flag
          the user has removed himself from participation in the
          meeting.

if the user is selecting meetings to which he is eligible, the "e" flag
is not printed, it is assumed).

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
