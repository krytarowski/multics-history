02/12/85  entries

Syntax as a command:  entries star_names {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [entries star_names {-control_args}]


Function: returns the entrynames or absolute pathnames of segments,
directories, multisegment files (MSFs), links, data management (DM)
files, and extended entries that match one or more star names.


Arguments:
star_names
   are star names to be used in selecting the names to be returned.


Control arguments:
-absolute_pathname, -absp
   returns absolute pathnames rather than entrynames.
-chase
   will process the targets of links when a starname is specified.
-no_chase
   will not process the targets of links when a starname is specified.
   (Default)
-select_entry_type STR, -slet STR
   returns entrynames of entries of the specified types.  You need not
   give the suffix in the starname.  Use the list_entry_types command
   to obtain a list of valid entry type values. STR is a comma separated
   list of entry types, such as: mailbox,ms,mcacs.


Notes: Only one name per entry is returned; i.e., if an entry has more
than one name that matches a starname, only the first match found is
returned.

Since each entryname (or pathname) returned by entries is enclosed in
quotes, the command processor treats each name as a single argument
regardless of the presence of special characters in the name.

See the directories, directory, and entry commands.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
