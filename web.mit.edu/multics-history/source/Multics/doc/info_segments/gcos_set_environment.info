08/02/84  gcos_set_environment, gse

Syntax as a command:  gse {-control_args}


Function:  This command may be given in the user's process before the
gcos_tss command is invoked, to modify the user-controlled run-time
parameters for GTSS.


Control arguments:
-directory_mapping mapping_rule, -drm mapping_rule
   sets the directory mapping to use the specified mapping_rule.  The
   following mapping rules are allowed:  umc, smc, and wd.  The default
   is wd.
-gcos_debug_pathname path, -gdbpn path
   sets the path of the control file to be used when the gcos_debug
   command is invoked.  (If path is not specified a Default of
   >udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.gdb is used.)
-modes modes_string
   sets the modes, according to modes_string.  Mode names are separated
   by commas, each one optionally preceded by a circumflex (^) to turn
   the specified mode off.  Modes not specified in modes_string are
   left unchanged.


   ast
       prints the asterisk for each input request in GTSS build mode.
       When off, no prompt character is given.  (Default is on)
   drl
       prints trace information on each derail.  The derail name and
       its location are printed.  (Default is off)
   gdb
       gcos_debug breaks are inserted in slave object code as it is
       loaded.  The gcos_debug command is invoked when such a break is
       encountered during execution.  (Default is off)
   mcmd
       allows the use of the e request at GTSS command level.  When
       allowed, the remainder of the input line is passed on to the
       Multics command processor.  (Default is off)


   mquit
       GTSS goes to a new Multics command level in response to the quit
       (or break) key.  When off, depressing the quit key on the
       terminal resets the current GCOS time sharing subsystem function
       and returns to GTSS command level.  (Default is off)
   ss
       prints trace information about each subsystem call.  The
       subsystem name is printed.  (Default is off)
-print, -pr
   displays on the user_output switch the current control information
   set by this command.  If there are multiple control arguments,
   -print is the last one processed.
-reset, -rs
   sets all modes to the default.


-smc_pathname path, -spn path
   sets path as the root directory to be used when catalog/file strings
   are mapped into Multics pathnames using the system master catalog
   (SMC) directory mapping rule.  This control argument is required
   when -directory_mapping smc is specified.
-umc_name name, -unm name
   sets the user master catalog (UMC) name to be used for catalog/file
   string operations where UMC name is only implied.  Name may be given
   in upper or lowercase, but otherwise is equivalent to the user's
   GCOS login USERID.  This control argument is required when
   -directory_mapping umc or -directory_mapping smc is specified.  The
   UMC name is mapped to lowercase for use in constructing Multics
   pathnames.


Notes:  The user must have at least status access to the directory
implied by the directory mapping_rule and to its containing directory.

If any error is detected by the gcos_set_environment command, no
changes are made to any of the user-controlled runtime parameters.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
