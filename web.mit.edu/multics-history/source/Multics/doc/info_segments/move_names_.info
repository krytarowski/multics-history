:Entry: move_names_: 02/03/84  move_names_


Function: moves all the entry names, except the one used to designate
the original segment, from one segment to another.  Name duplications
are handled by nd_handler_.


Syntax:
declare move_names_ external entry (char(*), char(*), char(*), char(*),
     char(*), bit(1) aligned, fixed bin(35));
call move_names_ (dir_name, entry_name, target_dir, target_name,
     caller, error_sw, code);


Arguments:
dir_name
   is the directory in which the original segment is found.  (Input)
entry_name
   is a name on the original segment.  (Input)
target_dir
   is the target segment's directory.  (Input)
target_name
   is a name already on the target segment.  (Input)
caller
   is the name of the calling procedure; it is used in calls to
   nd_handler_.  (Input)


error_sw
   indicates which segment the error indicated by "code" occurred on;it
   is set to "0"b if the error was on the original segment and to "1"b
   if on the target.  (Output)
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output)


Notes:  If a name duplication occurs and the conflicting name is not
deleted, then the code "error_table_$namedup" is returned to the
caller.  The names that occur after the conflicting name are processed.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
