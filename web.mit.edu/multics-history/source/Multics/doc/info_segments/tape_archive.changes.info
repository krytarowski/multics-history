This info describes changes to the tape_archive utility.


Version 4, MR10.2:

o  independent densities for primary and alternate volume sets are 
   supported.  A new optional control argument '-alternate' may be
   specified on the 'ta alter table density N' request to indicate
   which volume set density is to be changed.
   
o  all mount requests issued by tape_archive contain a '-density'
   argument to enable the system to choose an appropriate tape drive
   in a mixed hardware configuration.  It is currently possible (but
   not likely) for a tape_archive volume set to actually be recorded
   at a density different from that specified in the table.  With
   version 4 the recording density in the table MUST match the
   corresponding volume set density.  If problems are encountered in
   this area, the actual recording density of a volume set can be
   determined using the read_tape_and_query utility and the tape
   archive table can be brought into step using the 'ta alter table
   density N' request.


o  'xd' and 'xdf' requests have been added which extract a component
   and then delete it from the tape archive.
   
o  the 'cancel' request can correctly reinstate components dead
   components which have been processed as deleted but are still on
   the volume set.
   
o  the 't' request produces header information when -long is
   specified and the table is empty.


o  an auto_compaction limit of 1.0 is handled correctly and never
   causes automatic scheduling of volume set compaction.
   
o  'r'-type requests issued for a non-existent table proceed by
   creating the table with a warning.
   
o  extra checks have been added to prevent the deletion of the active
   tape_archive table out from under current processing.      

o  redundant tape mounts have been eliminated by only writing the
   tape_archive table to tape if the volume set has in fact changed.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
