03/01/84  display_pvte

Syntax: display_pvte {dskX_NN} {-control_args}
    or: display_pvte {PVNAME} {-control_args}


Function: displays information from the Physical Volume Table Entry
(PVTE) for a mounted storage system volume.


Arguments:
dskX_NN
   specifies the disk subsystem and unit on which the volume is mounted
   (e.g., dska_05).
PVNAME
   is the physical volume name of the disk volume (e.g., rpv).


Control arguments:
-long, -lg
   displays information from the volume label.
-pvid PVID
   specifies the disk unit by the unique identifier assigned to the
   physical volume when it was registered (PVID), a 12-digit octal
   number.


Access required: This command requires access to metering_gate_.
If -long is used, access to phcs_ is also required.


Notes: A disk unit must be specified by only one of the following--
dskX_NN, PVNAME, or -pvid PVID.  The requested unit must represent a
mounted storage system volume.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
