Syntax:  .ifi tab "table-title"


Function:
This compose macro
1) increments the table counter
2) outputs a centered, perhaps multiline table heading above the table
   with appropriate spacing.
3) adds the 'table-title' to the list of Tables in the Table of
   Contents if the creation of such a list has been enabled (see
   tabl_on.info)


Arguments:
'table-title' is the title of the table, as it is to appear in the list
   of Tables in the Table of Contents (initial caps, no underlines).


Notes:
1) The table counter is maintained on a per-section basis for documents
   done in sections (those in which the 'section' variable has been
   set), and on a per-document basis for all other documents.
2) After the tab macro is used, the 'table' compose variable contains
   the table number of the current table.  'table' will be of the form
   '<section>-N' if the 'section' variable has been set.  'table' can
   be used in the text to refer to the current table.  (See
   tab_get_no.info for references to a table other than the current
   table.)
3) See tab_index.info, tab_on.info, and tab_get_no.info for related
   information.


Examples:
The following lines generate a simple table following some text:

     These relationships are shown in the table below.
     .ifi tab "Relationships Table"
	NAME	     PLACE
	Paris	     France
	Rome	     Italy
	  .

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
