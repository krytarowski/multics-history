(Describes changes to the MR10.1 version of the cv_pmf command.)


The cv_pmf command has been changed to allow the name of the
Project Master File (PMF) segment to end with the suffix ".pmf".
For compatability with previous versions of the command, it is
not necessary that the PMF segment name have this suffix.


The command "cv_pmf PMF_name" will cause cv_pmf to first look for
the segment PMF_name.pmf. If it is found, it is converted and
the result placed in the segment PMF_name.pdt. If the segment
PMF_name.pmf is not found, cv_pmf will look for the segment PMF_name;
if it is found, cv_pmf prints a warning message and converts the
PMF, placing the output in the segment PMF_name.pdt.
If neither segment is found, an error message is printed.


cv_pmf error processing:

If errors occur during conversion, cv_pmf will delete the
output segment (PMF_name.pdt) only if just created by cv_pmf.
If the segment existed before this invocation of cv_pmf, it will
be truncated.

cv_pmf now supports the severity active function.  The result of
[severity cv_pmf] is the highest severity of any warning or error which
occured during the conversion.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
