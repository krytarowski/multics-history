08/01/84  display_mrds_scope_settings, dmss

Syntax as a command:  dmss


Function:  This command displays concurrency control scope mode
information for all currently open data bases in the user's process.
The versions of the concurrency control, data base, and submodel (if
used for the opening) are displayed, as well as the absolute paths of
the data base and the submodel (if used for the opening).  The opening
mode is also displayed.


Notes:  All versions of data base scope settings may be displayed with
r-s-m-d modes used for version 3 and earlier data bases, and read_attr,
modify_attr, append_tuple, and delete_tuple (abbreviated as r-m-a-d)
used for version 4 data bases with version 5 concurrency control.  (See
the notes section of adjust_mrds_db on version 5 concurrency control;
this is not the same as version 5 submodels.)

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
