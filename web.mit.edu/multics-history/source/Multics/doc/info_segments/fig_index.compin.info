Syntax:  .ifi fig_index "figure-title"


Function:
This compose macro adds a 'figure-title' to the list of Illustrations
in the Table of Contents if creation of such a list has been enabled
(see fig_on.info) without putting a centered Figure caption on the
output page.


Arguments:
'figure-title' is the title of the figure, as it is to appear in the
   list of Illustrations (first caps, no underlines).


Notes:
1) The fig_index macro is used to generate a list of Illustrations
   entry when, for any reason, the fig macro cannot be used to create
   the figure caption.
2) This macro advances the figure counter so care must be taken in
   referencing the figure in the text.
3) See fig.info, fig_on.info, and fig_get_no.info for related
   information.


Examples:
The following lines produce a figure with a left-justified figure
caption.

			  F I G U R E
     .ifi fig_get_no 1
     .spb
     .ur Figure %figure%:  Figure Data, 1975
     .spb
     .ur Figure %figure% above reflects the 1975 data.
     .ifi fig_index "Figure Data, 1975"

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
