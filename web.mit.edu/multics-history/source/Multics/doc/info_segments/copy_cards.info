02/29/84  copy_cards, ccd

Syntax:  ccd deck_name {new_deck_name}


Function: copies specified card image segments from system pool
storage into your working directory.


Arguments:
deck_name
   is the name that was entered on the deck_id card  when the card
   deck was submitted for reading.  The star convention is allowed.
new_deck_name
   is the pathname of the segment in which the matching card image
   segment is placed.  If omitted, the working directory and deck_name
   are assumed.  The equal convention is allowed.


Notes: The segments to be copied must have been created using the
Multics card input facility.  When there are multiple copies of the
same deck in pool storage, all are copied.

When an attempt is made to read a card deck having the same name as
some previously read deck still in pool storage, a numeric suffix is
added to the name of the new deck, e.g., "deck_name.1"

Only those card decks having an access class equal to your current
authorization can be copied; other decks are not found.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
