Syntax:  .ifi fig_get_no n


Function:
This compose macro generates the number of a figure other than the
current figure.


Arguments:
'n' is an integer; the number of the nth figure relative to the current
   figure.


Notes:
1) The number of the nth figure relative to the current figure (e.g.,
   -1 = first preceding, 2 = second following) is calculated and set
   into the 'figure' compose variable.	The form of the number is the
   same as that generated by the fig macro (see fig.info.)	'figure' is
   used to refer to the desired figure.
2) See fig.info, fig_on.info, and fig_index.info for related
   information.


Examples:
The following lines reference the next three figures that will appear
in the text of an unsectioned document.

     .ifi fig_get_no 1
     .ur Figure %figure%,
     .ifi fig_get_no 2
     .ur Figure %figure%, and
     .ifi fig_get_no 3
     .ur Figure %figure% below illustrate these results.

Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 3 below illustrate these results.


The following lines reference the two figures that have just appeared
in the text of Section 4 of a document.

     .ifi fig_get_no -1
     .ur See Figure %figure%,
     .ifi fig_get_no 0
     .ur Figure %figure% above.

See Figure 4-1 and Figure 4-2 above.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
