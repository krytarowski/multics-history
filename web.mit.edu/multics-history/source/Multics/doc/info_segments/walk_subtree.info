08/31/83  walk_subtree, ws

Syntax:  ws path command_line {-control_args}


Function:  executes a specified command line in the directory selected
(called the starting node) and in its inferior directories.  It prints
the pathname of every directory in which the command line is executed.


Arguments:
path
   is the starting node.  This must be the first argument.  A path of
   -working_directory (-wd) specifies the working directory.
command_line
   is the command line to be executed.  The entire command line is
   taken to be a single argument.  A multiple-word command line should
   be typed as a quoted string.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses printing of the names of the directories in which the
   command line is executed.
-bottom_up, -bu
   causes execution of the command line to commence at the last level
   and to proceed upward through the storage system hierarchy until the
   first level is reached.  In the default mode, execution begins at
   the highest (first) level and proceeds downward to the lowest (last)
   level.
-first N, -ft N
   makes N the first level in the storage system hierarchy at which the
   command line is to be executed, where, by definition, the starting
   node is level 1.  The default is -ft 1.


-last N, -lt N
   makes N the last level in the storage system hierarchy at which the
   command line is to be executed.  The default is -lt 99999, i.e., all
   levels.
-msf
   treats multisegment files as directories, which, normally, are not
   considered as such.
-priv
   invokes a highly privileged primitive to list directories.  It
   requires access to the hphcs_ gate.


Notes:  This command has a cleanup handler--if one quits out of it and
immediately types "rl" (release), one's directory is changed back to
what it was prior to walk_subtree's invocation.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
