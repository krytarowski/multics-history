02/11/85  delete_iacl_seg, dis

Syntax as a command:  dis path {User_ids} {-control_args}


Function: deletes entries from a segment initial access control list
(initial ACL) in a specified directory.  A segment initial ACL contains
the ACL entries to be placed on segments created in the specified
directory.  (See IACL.gi.)


Arguments:
path
   specifies the pathname of a directory whose segment initial ACL is
   to be changed.  If it is -working_directory (-wd) or omitted, your
   working directory is assumed.  The star convention is allowed.
User_ids
   are access control names of the form Person_id.Project_id.tag.  All
   entries in the directory initial ACL that match the User_ids are
   deleted.  (For a description of the matching strategy, see the
   set_acl command.)  If you give no User_ids, your Person_id and
   current Project_id are assumed.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   deletes the entire initial ACL except an entry for *.SysDaemon.*.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the messages "User name not on ACL of path" and "Empty
   initial ACL."
-ring N, -rg N
   identifies the ring number whose directory initial ACL is to be
   deleted.  It can appear anywhere on the line and affects the whole
   line.  If present, follow it by N (where 0 <= N <= 7).  If not
   given, your ring is assumed.


Access required: Your must have modify (m) permission on the
directory.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
