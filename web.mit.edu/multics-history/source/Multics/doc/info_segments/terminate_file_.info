:Entry:  terminate_file_:  01/18/83  terminate_file_

Syntax:
dcl terminate_file_ entry (ptr, fixed bin (24), bit (*), fixed bin (35));
call terminate_file_ (seg_ptr, bit_count, switches, code);


Function:  Performs common operations after a program has finished
with a segment.  It optionally sets the bit count, truncates the
segment to a bit boundary, terminates a null reference name from the
segment, and ensures that modified pages of the segment are no longer
in main memory.  It can also be instructed to delete the segment.


Arguments:
seg_ptr
   is a pointer to the segment.  If null on input, no action is taken.
   Set to null after a null reference name on the segment is terminated.
   (Input/Output)
bit_count
   is the new bit count of the segment.  (Input)
switches
   control the action of this subroutine.  See the "Notes" section.
   (Input)
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output)


Notes:  The following structure describes the meanings of the switches.

 dcl 1 terminate_file_switches based,
       2 truncate	 bit (1) unal,
       2 set_bc	 bit (1) unal,
       2 terminate	 bit (1) unal,
       2 force_write bit (1) unal,
       2 delete	 bit (1) unal;

This structure is declared in terminate_file.incl.pl1.  The named
constants in the "List of named constants" section are also declared
with one or more of the above bits on.

If a request is made to delete the segment, any other options selected
are performed first in case it is not possible to delete the segment.


List of named constants:
TERM_FILE_TRUNC
   truncate the segment to bit_count bits
TERM_FILE_BC
   set the bit count to bit_count
TERM_FILE_TERM
   terminate a null reference name on the segment
TERM_FILE_TRUNC_BC
   truncate the segment to the bit_count bits and set the bit count
   to bit_count
TERM_FILE_TRUNC_BC_TERM
   truncate the segment to the bit_count bits, set the bit count to 
   bit_count, and terminate a null reference name on the segment


TERM_FILE_FORCE_WRITE
   ensure that modified pages of the segment are no longer in main
   memory
TERM_FILE_DELETE
   delete the segment

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
