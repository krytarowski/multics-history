Syntax:  mrc function_name {args}


Function:	 Provides a command level interface to the Multics Relational Data
Store (MRDS) Data Sublanguage, which is a subroutine interface dsl_ with
several entry points.


Arguments:
function_name
   this is the name of one of the dsl_ entry points, or one of the two
   mrds_call functions list_dbs or set_modes.  The dsl entry points available
   are close, declare, define_temp_rel, delete, dl_scope, dl_scope_all,
   get_population, get_scope, modify, open, retrieve, set_scope, set_scope_all,
   and store.
args
   these are the individual arguments required by a particular dsl_ entry
   point, such as database index and relation name for store, or pathname and
   open mode for open.  See the particular dsl_ entry point help file for
   details.


Notes:  None of the dsl_ functions require the inclusion of the error code
argument, as this will be reported via com_err_ if non-zero.

The argument order is the same as for the corresponding dsl_ entry point.

For entries that take a selection expression, it can be given in quotes, or the
last argument can be -segment, -sm path to take the selection expression from a
segment.

Scope modes are encoded to the characters n, r, a(or s), d, m, and u.	 Opening
modes are encoded to the characters r, u, er, and eu.

Retrieve is a special case, the number of values to be retrieved must be given
before the database index argument.  In addition, if the last argument is -all,
successive -another calls will be made, to retrieve all data statisfying the
conditions.

The funtion close will accept a database index, or -all.

The function list_dbs takes no arguments.

The funtion set_modes takes the arguments list/no_list, and long_err/short_err
to control the amount of output from mrds_call.


Examples:
mrds_call open dept_store eu

The open data base is:
1	>udd>m>jg>dr>dept_store
	exclusive_update

mrds_call store 1 emp 1 1 1 1 1 1

mrds_call retrieve 6 1 "-range (e emp) -select e" -all

The values are:

1
	1
1
	1
	   1.00
	   1.00

(END)

mrds_call close -all

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
