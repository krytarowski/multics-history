01/23/86 copy_names

Syntax as a command:  copy_names path1 {path2...path1N path2N}


Function: copies all names of one entry (directory, segment,
multisegment file, data management file, extended entry, or link) to
another.


Arguments:
path1
   pathname of entry whose names are to be copied.  The star convention
   is allowed.
path2
   pathname of entry to which all names are copied.  If you omit
   path2N, names are copied onto an entry in you working directory with
   the same entryname as path1N.  The equal convention is allowed.


Notes: All names are left on the original entry.  The two entries
cannot reside in the same directory because duplicate names are not
allowed in a directory.

Only one matching name per entry is used when resolving the equal name.
This is the first matching name on that entry (in the order returned by
hcs_$star_) for which the specified equal name exists.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
