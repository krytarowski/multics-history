01/03/83  protection notices and their names


Function: Segments with the pnotice suffix contain a software
protection notice file.  These segments:

1) Are ASCII templates containing the text of a software protection
notice.  They are input exactly as they are to appear in source or
in PNOTICE segments.  For example:
Copyright, (C) Honeywell Information Systems Inc.,  1981

No comment boxes or other highlights should be included.
2) Are used by the tools generate_pnotice and add_pnotice to
provide standardized, legal protection of Multics software.
3) Are indirectly used by the display_psp, display_pnotice and
list_pnotice_names commands to provide information as to what
notice(s) are in modules.


Copyright naming conventions:
Copyright  protection  notices  must  conform  to  the following
naming conventions:

A) The primary name of a copyright pnotice file must consist of three
components. These three components are:
Component 1: <party or parties>_<version of this notice>  where:
<party or parties> is, for example, HIS or MIT, or both, and
<version of this notice> is a single, uppercase letter, A through
Z.  The version is used to indicate  notices  that  are grammatically
different, exclusive of the year date.  The default copyright notice,
and any other notices that are identical,  with exception of the year
date, need NOT have a version letter.
Component 2: <4-digit year>
Component 3: "pnotice" suffix.


B) The copyright notice that is to be used as the default by the 
add_pnotice command must have the added name "default.pnotice".
THIS IS THE ONLY ADDED NAME PERMITTED ON ANY COPYRIGHT NOTICE.

C) For Honeywell only copyright notices, the primary name must follow
the format: HIS_<version, if applicable>.<4-digit year>.pnotice.
For example, HIS.1981.pnotice may be the default copyright with text:

      Copyright (C) by Honeywell Information Systems Inc., 1981
and HIS_A.1980.pnotice may have the following text:

      Copyright (C), 1980 by Honeywell Information Systems, Inc.
Other single party notices must follow a similar format.


D) For MIT and Honeywell joint copyright notices, the primary name must
follow the format:
MIT_HIS_<version, if applicable>.<4-digit year>.pnotice.
Other two party notices must follow a similar format.


E) An appropriate name for other joint copyright notices between
Honeywell and another party will be determined when such cases
arise.


Trade secret naming conventions:
Trade Secret pnotice file naming must follow these conventions:

F) The primary name of a Trade Secret pnotice file must consist of
three components. These three components are:
Component 1: <party or parties>_<version of this notice> where:
<party or parties> is, for example, HIS or MIT, or both, and
<version of this notice> is a single uppercase letter, A through Z.
The version is used to indicate notices that are grammatically
different.
Component 2: The literal string: trade_secret
Component 3: "pnotice" suffix.

G) For the Honeywell Trade Secret notice, the primary name must be:
HIS.trade_secret.pnotice.
No version is necessary. Other parties' trade secret notices should
follow a similar format.

H) The default Trade Secret notice must have the added name:
default_trade_secret.pnotice
THIS IS THE ONLY ADDED NAME PERMITTED ON ANY TRADE SECRET NOTICE.


Public domain naming conventions:
Public Domain pnotice file naming must follow these conventions:

I) The primary name of a Public Domain pnotice file must consist of
three components. These three components are:
Component 1: The literal string: public
Component 2: The literal string: domain
Component 3: "pnotice" suffix.

J) For the Public Domain notice, the primary name must be:
public.domain.pnotice
and the text of this notice must be:
"This is in the PUBLIC DOMAIN and may be copied without permission."


Notes:
As mentioned earlier, the only pnotice templates which are allowed
to have added names are the default templates. For reasons of
efficiency, the name default.pnotice or default_trade_secret.pnotice
must appear as the second name on the template. The primary name must
be the name described in paragraph (A), (F) or (J) above.

The following command line is suggested to check all of the pnotice
templates for consistency, and should be used whenever new templates
have been created:
    list_pnotice_names -check -all

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
