AT58 (Level 68 Multics Fortran Manual)


02/15/89 Errata Information for MR 12.2


Page 2-6 change the line:

  The maximum number of characters allowed in a single character string
  is 256.

to read:

  The maximum number of characters allowed in a single character string
  constant is 512. The maximum size of a character variable is 1301071
  (128K-1).

  The  use  of  large  character variables may cause the compiler to
  indicate that it has overflowed the limit of 62000 words of automatic
  storage, or 128K words of static storage. This can be avoided by
  compiling with the -large_array (-la) option.


Page 6-8 under the section entitled "Equivalence Statement".

Change the first line from
    > Syntax
           equivalence (e, e[,e]...) [,(e, e [,e]...)]...
      where each e is a variable or array name.
to
    > Syntax
           equivalence (e, e[,e]...)[,(e, e [,e]...)]...
     where each e is a variable, array, array element or character substring
     name.

Add the following line:

    > Substring indexes are unsigned integer constants and can only take on
      positive values.
after
   > Subscripts are all unsigned integer constants or constant expressions,
     and they may take on negative values.


Add the following line into "Examples of valid equivalence group" section:
    > equivalence (x(1:4), y(2:))

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
