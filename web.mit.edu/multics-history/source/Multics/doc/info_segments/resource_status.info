02/20/85  resource_status, rst

Syntax as a command:  rst type STR1...STRN {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [rst type name -control_arg]


Function: prints selected information about the status of a given
resource.  As an active function, returns the value requested by the
specified control argument.


Arguments:
type
   is a resource type defined in the resource type description table
   (RTDT).  (For more information and for a list of the resource types
   on the system, use the list_resources and list_resource_types
   commands.)
STRi
   is the unique identifying name of the particular resource desired.
   If STR looks like a control argument, precede it by -name.


Control arguments:
-access_class, -acc
   prints the AIM access class or the access class range of the
   resource.
-acs_path
   prints the pathname of the ACS for this resource.
-all, -a
   prints all information maintained about this resource.  It is not
   allowed in the active function.
-alloc
   prints the state of your allocation switch for this resource.
-attributes, -attr
   prints the current and protected attributes of this resource.
-charge_type, -crgtp
   prints the charge type for this resource.


-comment, -com
   prints the user-settable comment associated with this resource.
-location, -loc
   prints the location field associated with this resource.
-lock
   prints the status of the resource lock for this resource.  In the
   active function, returns "true" if the lock is on, "false" if it is
   off.
-mode, -md
   prints your effective mode to the resource.
-owner, -ow
   prints the name of the owner of the resource.
-potential_access_class, -pacc
   prints the potential access class or potential access class range
   for this resource.


-potential_attributes, -pattr
   prints the potential attributes of this resource.
-priv
   returns your privileged effective access to the resource (see
   "Access required" below)
-release_lock, -rll
   prints the status of the lock that prevents the owner from releasing
   this resource.  In the active function, returns "true" if the lock

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
