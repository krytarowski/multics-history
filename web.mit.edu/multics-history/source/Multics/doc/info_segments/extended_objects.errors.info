Description

22  
switch_(on off) will not work with non-standard switches of extended
objects.

13  
standard objects (seg, dir, msf, dm file) don't return suffix_info
flags correctly.  flags for all should be:  suffix_info.standard = "1"b
and suffix_info.extended_acl = "0"b.

12  
suffix_XXX_ must return "0"b for suffix_info.standard_object and "1"b
for suffix_info.extended_acl if it uses extended acls.  failure to set
standard_object to "0" for all suffix_XXX_$suffix_info and extended_acl
to "1"b for thise types that use extended acl will cause acl_commands_
to refuse to work in many different situations.

11  
status blows up when reporting about DM files when it tries to free
storage through a null pointer.

1  phx16345
fs_copy_util_ does not check for consistency in the original MSF when
copying to the new MSF.  if component 0 does not exist, it complains
about not finding it, but does not care about any other missing
component.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
