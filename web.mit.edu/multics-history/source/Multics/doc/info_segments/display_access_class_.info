:Entry:  display_access_class_:  10/07/86  display_access_class_ 

						
Syntax:
declare display_access_class_$display_access_class entry (bit(72)
     aligned, char(32) aligned);
call display_access_class_$display_access_class (aim_bits, aim_chars);


The display_access_class_ function converts a bit(72) aligned
representation of an access authorization or access class into a
character string of the form
   LL...L:CC...C
where LL...L is an octal sensitivity level number, and CC...C is an
octal string representing the access category set.


Arguments:
aim_bits
   is the binary representation to be converted.  (Input)
aim_chars
   is the character string representation.  (Output)


Notes: Only significant digits of the level number (usually a single
digit from 0 to 7) are printed.

Currently, only 18 access category bits are used, so that only six
octal digits are required to represent access categories.  Therefore,
aim_chars is padded on the right with blanks, which may be used at a
later time for additional access information.  Trailing zeros are NOT
stripped.

If either the level or category field of aim_bits is invalid, the
erroneous field is returned as full octal (6 digits for level, 12
digits for category), followed by the string "(undefined)".


:Entry: range:  10/07/86 display_access_class_$range


Function: The display_access_class_$range function converts an AIM
access class range to a character string when the names of levels and
categories are not available.


Syntax:
declare display_access_class_$range entry ((2) bit(72) aligned char(32)
     aligned);

call display_access_class_$range (AIM_range, string_range)


Arguments:
AIM_range
   is a standard access class range.  (Input)
string_range
   is a string of the form
      l:cccccc-L:CCCCCC
   where l is the level, from 0 to 7, of the bottom of the range.
   (Output)
   cccccc are the categories of the bottom of the range.

   The categories are a bit string (one bit per category) represented
   in octal.

   L is the level, from 0 to 7, of the top of the range.
   CCCCCC are categories of the top of the range.

   The categories are a bit string (one bit per category) represented
   in octal.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
