         A <label prefix> that has a <declared name> as the       |
         <prefix subscript> rather than a <decimal integer> must  |
         have been declared with the options (constant) attribute |
         and evaluated to a <decimal integer>.                    |


pg 2-6:  in the section "Bit-string constants", after the
     paragraph beginning with "A <bit-string constant>
     denotes....", add the following.

         The <decimal integer> must be either a decimal integer
         literal or a named constant yielding a decimal integer
         value.


pg 2-7:  in the section "Character-String Constants", after the
     paragraph beginning with "A <character-string constant>
     denotes....", add the following.

         The <decimal integer> must be either a decimal integer
         literal or a named constant yielding a decimal integer
         value.


pg 5-26.1: in the section "Options", after the last paragraph add |
     the following paragraph:                                     |

         A variable declared with "options(constant)" may take    |
         the place of a literal constant in declarations (the     |
         scale, precision, initial value, and <extent             |
         expression>, only) and in subscripted label arrays.      |


pg 13-6.1: in the section "Rank" replace                          |
                                                                  |
         X must be a character string of length 1.                |
     with                                                         |
         X must be a non-varying character string of length 1.    |

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
