04/11/83  cancel_imft_request, cir

Syntax:  cir request_identifiers {-control_args}


Function: cancels requests in the Inter-Multics File Transfer queues.


Arguments:
request_identifiers
   determine which requests in the selected queues
   (-queue/-all/-ds/-sc) belonging to the specified users (-own/-user)
   are cancelled.  See "Notes on request identifiers" below.


List of request_identifiers:
path
   cancels all requests from the appropriate queues and users whose
   source pathnames match the relative pathname path.  The star
   convention is allowed.
-entry STR, -et STR
   cancels all requests from the appropriate queues and users whose
   source entry names match STR; the directory portions of the source
   pathnames are ignored.  The star convention is allowed.
-id STR
   cancels all requests from the appropriate queues and users whose
   request IDs match the STR.  Type "help request_ids.gi" for a
   description of the syntax of STR.


Control arguments:
-destination STR, -ds STR
   cancels requests that are queued for transfer to the remote system
   identified by STR.  STR must be one of the names listed by the
   print_imft_sites command.
-source STR, -sc STR
   cancels requests that are queued for transfer from the remote system
   identified by STR.  STR must be one of the names listed by the
   print_imft_sites command.  If neither -destination nor -source is
   specified, the default is -destination imft.
-queue N, -q N
   cancels requests entered in priority queue N for the above
   destination or source where N is an integer between 1 and 4
   inclusive.  (Default -- depends on the destination or source
   specified)
-all, -a
   cancels requests entered in all priority queues for the above
   destination or source.


-brief, -bf
   suppresses messages telling that a particular request identifier did
   not match any requests or that requests were cancelled when using
   star names or the -all control argument.
-long, -lg
   displays the above messages. (Default)
-own
   cancels a matching request only if it was submitted by the user of
   this command.  (Default)
-user STR
   cancels a matching request only if it was submitted by the user
   identified by STR.


List of user specifications:
   the STR given to the -user control argument must have one of the
   following forms:
Person.Project
   cancels only those matching requests entered by the specified user
   while logged in on the specified project.
Person.*, Person
   cancels only those matching requests entered by the specified user
   while logged in on any project.
*.Project, .Project
   cancels only those matching requests entered by any user logged in
   on the specified project.
*.*, *
   cancels all matching requests regardless of who entered them.


Access required: If -user is specified, the user must have at least
"rd" extended access to the queue; otherwise, the user must have at
least "o" extended access.


Notes on request identifiers: Multiple -id STR request identifiers may
be specified on the command line only if no path or -entry STR
identifiers are given.

If path or -entry STR request identifiers are given, only one -id STR
request identifier may be given in which case only those requests which
match one of the path or -entry STR identifiers and which match the
-id STR identifier are cancelled.

If a path or -entry STR request identifier matches more than one
request and is not a starname, a message is printed telling how many
matching requests were found but none of the requests are cancelled.
The -id STR request identifier may be used to further qualify the path
or -entry STR identifier to select the specific request to cancel.


Notes: If the request is already being transferred, this command will
print a message and refuse to delete the entry from the queue.  The
user will have to contact the operations staff to cancel the transfer.

If conflicting control arguments (eg: -long and -brief, or -destination
and -source) are given on the command line, the rightmost control
argument takes effect.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
