08/14/84  linus

Syntax as a command:  linus {-control_args}


Function:
     This command invokes linus to access an MRDS data base.  It
provides both retrieval and update operations.  Data to be selected is
specified via query statements.


Control arguments:
-abbrev, -ab
   enables abbreviation expansion and editing of request lines.
-iteration, -it
   recognizes parentheses in the request line to indicate request line
   iteration.
-no_abbrev, -nab
   disables abbreviation expansion and editing of request lines.
   (Default)
-no_iteration, -nit
   parentheses in the request line are interpreted literally (i.e.,
   they do not cause request line iteration).  (Default)


-no_prompt, -npmt
   turns off prompting of strings.  This control argument can be
   overridden later (see set_mode request).  (Default is prompt)
-no_start_up, -nsu
   specifies that the subsystem start_up exec_com is not to be
   executed.
-profile path, -pf path
   specifies the pathname of the profile used for abbreviation
   expansion.  A profile suffix must be the last component to path;
   however, the suffix need not be supplied in the command line.  This
   control argument implies -abbrev.
-prompt STR
   sets the prompting string used by linus to STR.  If STR contains
   embedded blanks, it must be enclosed in quotes.  (Default linus
   prompt is "linus:".)


-request STR, -rq STR
   executes STR as a linus request line before entering the request
   loop.
-start_up, -su
   specifies that the subsystem start_up exec_com "start_up.lec" is
   executed prior to entering the request loop.  The start_up is
   searched for in the user's home directory, project directory, and
   then >site.  (Default)


Notes:  By default, linus prompts the user whenever input is expected
(the string "linus:" is displayed at linus request level).  Refer to
the description of the set_mode request for information on how to turn
off prompting.

Multics program_interrupt conditions are recognized and handled by
linus.  Thus, the user may interrupt any request and resume the linus
session by invoking the Multics program_interrupt command.  After the
program_interrupt command, linus waits for the user to type further
requests.


There is no data base creation facility within linus.  Those users who
wish to create their own data base should refer to Section 3 of the
Multics Logical Inquiry and Update System Reference Manual (AZ49) for
information on the creation of an MRDS data base.

After invoking linus, type "help" or "help intro" for further
information.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
