Syntax:  lnac {path {User_id}} {-control_args}


Function: scans a directory and lists segments and directories to which
a specified User_id does not have a given access condition.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the directory to be scanned.  If you omit path or
   give -working_directory (-wd), your working directory is scanned.
User_id
   is an access control name that can have null components.  If you
   omit it, your process's User_id is assumed.  The star convention
   is allowed.  (See the set_acl command.)


Control arguments:
-dir_mode STR
   lists directories to which the user does not have STR mode; STR can
   be any or all of the letters sma.
-seg_mode STR
   lists segments to which the user does not have STR mode; STR can be
   any or all of the letters rew.


Access required:  You must have status permission on the directory.


Notes:
You can't use User_id unless you have first supplied a path.

If no control arguments are given, the command lists all
segments and directories to which the user has null access.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
