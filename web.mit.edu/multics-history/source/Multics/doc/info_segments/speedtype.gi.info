Function:  expands text through the use of an online shorthand.


List of symbol dictionary maintenance commands:
add_symbols
   adds symbols to the current symbol dictionary.
change_symbols
   changes the expansion or suffixing of a symbol in the current
   symbol dictionary.
delete_symbols
   deletes symbols from the current symbol dictionary.
find_symbols
   finds and lists symbols in the current symbol dictionary that
   represent specified expansions.
list_symbols
   lists symbols in the current symbol dictionary.
option_symbols
   sets Speedtype options in the current symbol dictionary.


List of symbol dictionary selection commands:
print_symbols_path
   prints the pathname of the current symbol dictionary.
use_symbols
   sets the current symbol dictionary.


List of symbol expansion commands:
expand_symbols
   expands all the symbols in a specified text segment.
retain_symbols
   retains all symbols in a specified text segment by placing a
   Speedtype escape in front of each symbol.
show_symbols
   expands an input string and prints the output string.


Notes:  Symbols are created (usually several characters in length) for
frequently used words, phrases, or lengthy words, typed into a segment
in this short form, and expanded to their normal appearance.

Speedtype is similar to the Multics "abbrev" subsystem which expands
command line input.  In order to avoid confusion, so-called
abbreviations are termed "symbols" when discussing Speedtype.


All Speedtype commands use a current symbol dictionary.  The first
time a user executes a Speedtype command the default symbol dictionary
in the user's home directory is defined as the current symbol
dictionary.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
