02/21/84  daily_summary

Syntax:  daily_summary {-control_args}


Function: allows system administrators to print a summary of system
usage for the current billing period and a list of projects with
overspent accounts.  It also places a flag in the SAT for each project
that has an overspent account or has passed its termination date.


Control arguments:
-nocutr
   do not print a list of projects to be cutoff.
-nosat
   do not flag SAT entries.
-nosum
   do not print a system usage summary.
-warn
   for all projects to be cutoff, use a warning flag that permits users
   to login.


Notes:  The segments reqfile and smf.cur.sat are assumed to be present
in the working directory and are implicit inputs to the daily_summary
command.

This command writes the system usage of each project in the reqfile on
the sumry I/O switch.  The usage figures are cumulative from the time
that billing was last run.  It also writes a list of projects that have
run out of funds or are past the termination date and flags their SAT
entries on the cutrpt I/O switch.


The information about the closeness of a project to its limits, that is
used to decide whether to print a cutoff warning message when users on
the project log in, is placed in the SAT by this command.

The cutrpt and sumry I/O switches must be attached by the caller.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
