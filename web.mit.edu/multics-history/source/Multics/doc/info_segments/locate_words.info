10/20/86  locate_words, lw

Syntax as a command:  lw path words {-control_args}


Function:  locates all occurrences of a given word within a specified
text segment or MSF.  The user can specify more than one word to be
located.  For each occurrence of a given word within the text segment,
the number of the lines containing the word is displayed.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the text segment or MSF.
words
   are words to be located in the text segment.


Control arguments:
-count, -ct
   displays only the number of occurrences for each word.
-from n, -fm n
   the text segment is searched starting from the line number specified
   by n.  If this control argument is not specified, the text segment
   is searched starting from the first line.
-header, -he
   displays the pathname of the text segment.
-lines {n}, -li {n}
   for each occurrence of a given word, the lines (and line numbers)
   starting n lines before, through n lines after the line containing
   the word are displayed.  Thus, if n is 1, three lines are displayed.
   If n is not specified, only the line containing the word is
   displayed.  (Default)


-long, -lg
   for each occurrence of a given word, the line (and line number) of
   that word is displayed.
-to n
   the text segment is searched up to and including the line number
   specified by n.  If this control argument is not specified, the text
   segment is searched to the last line.
-word STR
   locates the word STR even though STR may look like a control
   argument.


Notes:  The -count control argument is mutually exclusive with the
-long and -lines control arguments.


Words are found in the text segment in the same way as described for
the create_wordlist command.  Words containing no letters can be found
even though they are normally excluded from a wordlist.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
