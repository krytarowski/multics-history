08/01/84  gcos_fms, gfms

Syntax as a command:  gfms REEL_NUMBER {-control_args}


Function:
Unload files from a GCOS master or user save tape.  Provides a
convenient means of transporting files from a GCOS environment to
use with the Multics GCOS simulators ("gcos" and "gtss" commands).
Multics directory hierarchy is created, along with any segments or
multi-segment files, to contain the GCOS catalog structure.


Arguments:
REEL_NUMBER is the tape reel identifier of the input save
tape.  This is in the form of a string of alphaumeric
characters (e.g., AAAAA). 


Control arguments:
-density N, -den N
   specifies that the the tape density is N where N is 200, 556, 800,
   1600 or 6250.  This argument is usually not necessary since the
   tape density is determined by inspection.
-track N, -tk N
   where N is either "7" or "9" to specify 7 or 9 track tape.  If
   the track argument is not included, the system DEFAULTS to 9
   track.
-restore UMC_NAME, -rest UMC_NAME
   restores the GCOS catalog structure identified by umc_name (user
   master catalog name).  The DEFAULT is obtained from the catalog on
   the tape.  (See "Notes" below.)


-directory_mapping RULE_NAME, -drm RULE_NAME
   establishes the directory mapping rule for the restore process.
   The rule_name should be entered as "umc", "smc", or "wd".  If smc
   is selected, then the control_arg "-smc_pathname path" must also
   be supplied.  DEFAULT is wd.  (See "Notes" below.)
-smc_pathname PATH, -spn PATH
   establishes the pathname for smc directory mapping if the
   -directory_mapping smc argument is supplied.
-no_acl
   prevents the ACL (access control list) for the segments containing
   the GCOS files from being determined from the permissions
   information on the SAVE TAPE (usually this information would be
   unrelated to Multics ACL's).


-control_file PATH, -cf PATH
   PATH specifies the pathname of a Multics segment containing a
   list of (only) those GCOS user names whose files are to be
   unloaded.  The contents of this segment are in the form
   "restorelist: user_name1 {, user_name2}...  ;" free format.


Notes:
The execution of gcos_fms with just a reel identifier results in
determining the density dynamically, determining whether a MASTER
or USER SAVE from tape information, and using the caller's working
directory.

The restored structure is placed in the Multics storage system
depending on the option given with the -directory_mapping
argument.  If the mapping rule is umc, the initial catalog (UMC)
is placed beneath the directory ">udd>umc_name", where umc_name
represents the name given after the -restore argument.  Thus all
subordinate structures are placed under the directory
">udd>umc_name>umc_name".  If the mapping rule is smc, the UMC
catalog is placed immediately under the directory named with the
-smc_pathname argument.  If the mapping rule is wd, the current


working directory is taken to be synonymous with the UMC catalog.
All subordinate structure is placed below the working directory.

The user process must have sma access to the directory below which
the restore is to be done.  For a restore with mapping rule "umc",
this usually requires the cooperation of the System Administrator
to either create the directory >udd>user_name, or to add the name
user_name to an existing project.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
