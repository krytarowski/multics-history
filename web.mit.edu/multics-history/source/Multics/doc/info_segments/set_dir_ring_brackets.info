08/22/83  set_dir_ring_brackets, sdrb

Syntax:  sdrb path {rb1 {rb2}}


Function:  allows a user to modify the ring brackets of a specified
directory.


Arguments:
path
   is the relative or absolute pathname of the directory whose ring
   brackets are to be modified.
rb1, rb2
   are the numbers that represent the directory ring brackets:  rb1 is
   the number to be used for the first ring bracket of the directory,
   and rb2 is the one to be used for the second.  The ring brackets
   must be in the allowable range v through 7 (where v depends on the
   user's current validation level) and must have the ordering:

         rb1<=rb2

   If rb1 and rb2 are omitted, they are set to the user's current
   validation level.  If rb1 is omitted, rb2 cannot be given and rb1
   and rb2 are set to the user's current validation level.


Notes:  The user's process must have a validation level less than or
equal to rb1.  See the Programmer's Reference Manual (AG93) for a
discussion of ring brackets and validation levels.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
