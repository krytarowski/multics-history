Description

6  phx13287
ioa_ resets the column count to zero on each invocation, regardless of
whether or not it was a $nnl.  This causes ^t to be passing useless with
ioa_$Xnnl.

This is extremely messy to improve, since per-switch static information
would be needed.  Even then, other iox_ calls could screw things up.
For the moment, then, ^t wil remain defined to refer to the current
fragment produced with the current call.  The documentation should be
made crystal clear on this issue.


5  phx12631
There is a failure to chase the actual_iocb_ptr pointer in some ofthe
calls in cross_ring_.  Thus syn_ attachments in the user ring fail.

4  phx07196
There is no arbitration for the several subsystem that claim to "own"
the basic terminal attachment.  Some protocol is needed.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
