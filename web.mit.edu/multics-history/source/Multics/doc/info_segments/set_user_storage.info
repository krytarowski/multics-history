02/22/85  set_user_storage

Syntax as a command:  set_user_storage {virtual_pointer} {-control_arg}


Function: establishes an area as the storage region in which normal
user allocations are performed.  These allocations include FORTRAN
common blocks and PL/I external variables whose names do not contain
dollar signs.


Arguments:
virtual_pointer
   is a virtual pointer to an initialized area (see
   virtual_pointers.gi).


Control arguments:
-create
   creates (and initializes) a system-free segment in your process
   directory.
-system
   specifies the area used for linkage sections.


Notes:  The control arguments must be given only if virtual_ptr is not
specified and vice versa.

To initialize or create an area, refer to the description of the
create_area command.  The area must be set up as either zero_on_free or
zero_on_alloc.  It is recommended that the area specified be
extensible.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
