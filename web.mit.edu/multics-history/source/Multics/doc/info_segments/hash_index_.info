:Entry: hash_index: 02/03/83  hash_index_


Function: returns the value of a hash function of a character string.


Syntax:
declare hash_index_ entry (ptr, fixed bin(21), fixed bin,
     fixed bin) returns (fixed bin);
hash_value = hash_index_ (string_ptr, string_len, mbz, table_size);


Arguments:
string_ptr
   is a pointer to the character string to be hashed.  This character
   string must be aligned.  (Input)
string_len
   is the length of the character string.  (Input)
mbz
   is reserved and must be zero.  (Input)
table_size
   is the number of entries in the hash table.  (Input)

Notes:
The value returned is between zero and table_size-1, inclusive.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
