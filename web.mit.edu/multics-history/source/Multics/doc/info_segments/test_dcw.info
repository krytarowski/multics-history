02/16/84  test_dcw

Syntax:  test_dcw {device} {name} {-control_args}


Function:  constructs and executes arbitrary DCW lists on any device
supported by the I/O interfacer.


Arguments:
device
   is the name of the device to be used.  This can be either a specific
   device name, such as "tape_02" or "puna," or a generic device type,
   such as "printer" or "disk."  If the device name is omitted, "tape"
   is assumed.
name
   is the name of the tape or disk volume to be mounted.  This argument
   is only used if the device is a tape or a disk.  If the tape or disk
   volume name is omitted, "scratch" is assumed.


Control arguments:
-read
   places the device in read-only mode.  This control argument only
   applies if the device is a disk or a tape.
-7track, -7tr
   specifies a 7-track tape drive.  It only applies if the device is a
   tape.


-priv
   specifies a privileged attachment (see "Notes" below).
-sys
   sets the system_flag in the rcp_ info structure during attachment
   (see "Notes").
-debug, -db
   runs the program in debug mode.  In this mode, only the editing
   requests are recognized; no execution is allowed, and no actual
   device attachment takes place.


Notes: The test_dcw command attaches the device selected using the
rcp_ subroutine.  Normally, the call is made to rcp_$attach as a
nonsystem process.  However, if -priv is used, the call is made to
rcp_priv_$attach.  In both cases, if -sys is used, the system_flag in
the rcp_ info structure is set, to indicate to rcp_ that you are to be
considered a system process.  You must have re access to the rcp_sys_
gate to make this kind of attachment.  If the device specified in the
command line is a device type rather than a specific device, rcp_ is
relied upon to select the actual device to be used.  In either case,
the name of the device actually attached is printed after attachment
completes.


After the test_dcw command is invoked, the following commands are read
from the user_input I/O switch: tdcw, idcw, nidcw, iotp, iotd, iontp,
odcw, pcw, opcw, edit (e), update (u), insert (i), delete (dl, d),
print (p), name, save, restore, execute (x), getstat (g), block (b),
xs, xr, xre, status (st), rs, dump patch, pattern, survey, dtstat,
chan, time, prompt, susp, rel, ? (question mark), . (period), and
quit, (q).  For details about these commands, see the Multics System
Diagnostic Aids (AR97).

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
