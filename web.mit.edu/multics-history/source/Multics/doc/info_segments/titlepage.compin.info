07/07/81	titlepage.compin, tp.compin

Syntax: .srv issue_date "Month Year"
     then
        .ifi titlepage "product" "title-1" ... "security"
     OR .ifi tp	   "product" "title-1" ... "security"


Function:
This compose macro creates the title page for a manual.  It
1) generates a masthead with the product line and one or more
   title lines set flush right in 12 and 14 pt Century Schoolbook
   Roman, all caps (see Arguments below)
2) sets the security notice centered in the space between the
   masthead and the first heading in 12 pt Helvetica, all caps
   (see Arguments below)
3) sets the text margin at 14 picas in from the page edge
4) creates the title page footer from the order number and the
   issue date.


Arguments:
'product' is the product line identifier, eg, SERIES 200/2000 or
   SERIES 60 (LEVEL 68).
'title-1 ...' is the title of the manual, usually given in not
   more than three lines.
'security' is the security notice.  Because the number of title
   lines is variable, 'security' must ALWAYS be the last argument
   and is given as "" for a unrestricted manual.


Note:
   If 'issue_date' is not set before using the titlepage macro,
   the current Month and year will be used.


Example:
The following is the beginning of the title page for the Ted
manual:  (The titlepage macro arguments are shown on two lines
because of space limitations in this info segments; the arguments
must all be given on the same line as the macro call)

     .ifi init_photo CP50-00
     .srv issue_date "March 1981"
     .ifi titlepage "Series 60 (Level 68)"
         "Ted Text Editor Users' Guide" "Preliminary Edition" ""
     	  .
     	  .

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
