02/20/84  charge_disk

Syntax:  charge_disk {path} {-control_arg}


Function:  is used by the daily disk accounting job (diskreport in the
master.ec segment) to record the disk usage figures for each project in
the project's projfile entry.  The figures are obtained from the
disk_stat file that is produced by the sweep command.  Figures are
recorded only for directories in the subtree below >udd.  Within that
subtree, charging may be enabled or disabled on a per-logical-volume
basis.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the disk_stat file from which the disk usage
   figures are obtained.  The default is the segment, disk_stat, in the
   working directory.


Control arguments:
-logical_volume names, -lv names
   where names is one or more logical volumes for which charging is to
   be enabled.  Charging for all other logical volumes is disabled.  If
   this argument is not given, it is assumed that all directories under
   >udd have their segments on the same logical volume, and charging
   for this volume is enabled.  The sons logical volume identifier of
   the first project directory encountered is used as the logical
   volume identifier of the volume for which charging is enabled.


Notes:  Dollar charges are not computed by charge_disk.  It records the
total month-to-date time-page product (tpp) for all directories
inferior to each project directory in the project's projfile entry.
The corresponding dollar charge is computed by the print_disk command
for printing only.  The disk charge actually billed is computed during
monthly billing, using the disk price in effect at that time.  (Thus a
change in the disk price made before billing is retroactive to the
beginning of the billing period.)


If the total tpp for a project, as computed from the figures in
disk_stat, is less than the previous day's month-to-date tpp recorded
in projfile, an error message is printed, and the projfile figure is
not changed.  This situation can arise in several ways, through system
or human error.  If a project directory is destroyed and then
re-created in a way that sets its tpp integrator back to zero instead
of to the previous value, charges start accruing from the date of the
re-creation and the charges for the portion of the month preceding the
destruction are lost.  When this happens, the set_tpp command can be
used to add the charge in projfile to the tpp integrator of the project
directory.  Before this is done, however, the system administrator
should analyze the situation carefully, to be sure that adding this
charge to the project is the correct thing to do.  If it is determined
that the projfile figure is the one in error, the edit_projfile command
can be used to correct it.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
