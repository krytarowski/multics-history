Syntax:  lr {-control_args}


Function:	 lists groups of resources managed by the Resource Control
Package (RCP), selected according to criteria specified by the user.


Control arguments:
-acquisitions, -acq
   lists resources acquired by the user specified by the -user control
   argument.  If this control argument is used, -type must also be
   specified.
-assignments, -asm
   lists resource assignments.  This cannot be used with the active
   function.
-awaiting_clear
   lists those resources that are awaiting manual clearing.
-device STR, -dv STR
   lists device resources with the name STR.  No other resources are
   listed.  This cannot be used with the active function.


-logical_volume, -lv
   lists logical volumes that are currently attached.  This cannot be
   used with the active function.
-long, -lg
   prints all the information known about each resource listed.  If
   this control argument is not supplied, only the name is printed for
   each resource listed.  This cannot be used with the active function.
   -lg has no effect if the -acq control argument has been specified.
-mounts, -mts
   lists resources currently mounted by the process.  This cannot be
   used with the active function.
-reservations, -resv
   lists only device and volume reservations.  This cannot be used with
   the active function.
-type STR, -tp STR
   lists resources of the type STR.  See list_resource_types for
   information on obtaining the names of resource types.


-user User_id
   selects a particular user or group of users for whom resource
   information is to be printed.  This control argument can be used
   only in conjunction with -acquisitions.  The User_id can be any of
   the following forms--

   Person.Project
      specifies a particular Person_id and Project_id combination.
   *.Project
      specifies all users on a specified project.
   *.*
      specifies all users (i.e., all acquired resources are listed).
   free
      specifies all resources in the free pool.


   system
      specifies all resources in the system pool.
   **
      specifies all users plus the free and system pools (i.e., all
      registered resources will be listed).

   If this control argument is not specified, the User_id of the user
   invoking list_resources is assumed.	See "Notes on Access
   Restrictions" below.


Notes on access restrictions:	 Access to rcp_admin_ is required to
obtain information on other users.  Read access to the PDT (Project
Definition Table) of a specified project is required to obtain
information for that project.


Notes:  If this command is invoked without any arguments, all resources
assigned and devices attached to the calling process are listed.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
