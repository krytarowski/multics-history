07/23/84  find_dict_words, fdw

Syntax as a command:  fdw {words} {-control_args}


Function:  The find_dict_words command finds and displays words
contained in the sequence of dictionaries defined by the dict search
list.


Arguments:
words
   are words to be found.  At least one word must be given unless the
   -input_file control argument is specified.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the warning message usually given when a word is not
   found.
-dictionary, -dict
   displays the pathname of the dictionary in which the word was found.
-exact_match, -exm
   finds only those words that match a dictionary word exactly, i.e.,
   no special processing is performed with respect to capitalization
   (see "Note" below).
-input_file path, -if path
   finds words in the segment specified by path.  Words in this segment
   must be separated by newlines.  This control argument may be
   specified more than once.


-output_file path, -of path
   writes words found into the segment specified by path instead of
   displaying words on the user's terminal.  Words are separated by
   newlines in the output segment.
-raw
   displays the words without indicating the no-trim attribute or
   hyphenation points (see add_dict_words command above).  Otherwise,
   words are printed in the format accepted by add_dict_words.
-word string
   finds the word string even though string may look like a control
   argument.


Notes:  When searching for a word in a dictionary, special processing
of capital letters is performed unless the -exact_match control
argument is specified.  This special processing is identical to that
performed by the trim_wordlist command below.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
