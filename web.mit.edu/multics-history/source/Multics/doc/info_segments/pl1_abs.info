Syntax:  pa paths {-pl1_args} {-dp_args} {-control_args}


Function: submits an absentee request to perform PL/I compilations.


Arguments: 
paths
   are the pathnames of segments to be compiled.
pl1_args
   are control arguments accepted by the pl1 command.
dp_args
   are control arguments (except -delete) accepted by the dprint
   command.


Control arguments:
-queue N, -q N
   is the priority queue of the request.  The default queue is defined
   by the system administrator.  See the Notes for a description of the
   interaction with the dprinting of listing files.
-hold
   do not dprint or delete any listing files.
-output_file path, -of path
   put absentee output in segment path.
-limit N, -li N
   specifies time limit in seconds for the absentee job.


Notes:
Control arguments and paths can be mixed freely and can appear anywhere
on the command line after the command.

Unpredictable results can occur if two absentee requests are submitted
that simultaneously attempt to compile the same segment or write into
the same absout segment.


If the -queue control argument is not specified, the request is
submitted into the default absentee priority queue defined by the site
and, if requested, the listing files will be dprinted in the default
queue of the request type specified on the command line.  (If no
request type is specified, the "printer" request type is used.)

If the -queue control argument is specified, and, if requested, the
listing files will be dprinted in the same queue as is used for the
absentee request.  If the request type specified for dprinting does not
have that queue, the highest numbered queue available for the request
type is used and a warning is issued.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
