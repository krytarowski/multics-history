01/27/84  reconnect_ec_enable

Syntax:  reconnect_ec_enable


Function:  invokes a search for the reconnect.ec segment upon
reconnection to a disconnected process.  The search begins in the home
directory, continues through the project directory, and then through
>sc1 until the segment is located, at which time the command "exec_com
>DIRECTORY_NAME>reconnect.ec" is executed.


Notes:  The reconnect_ec_enable command reverses the effect of the
reconnect_ec_disable command.

Use of reconnect.ec is enabled automatically by the standard process
overseer procedure process_overseer_.  Invocation of reconnect.ec is
not automatically enabled by the project_start_up_ process overseer
(see Section 7 of the MAM -- Project Administrator Manual, Order No.
AK51).  Thus, when using project_start_up_, the project administrator
may enable invocation of reconnect.ec at any point in the
project_start_up.ec.

The current command processor is used to execute the command.  Thus, if
the user is using the abbrev command processor, any applicable
abbreviation will be executed.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
