03/06/80  read_tsoapl_tape, rtt

Function: reads an IBM APL SELDUMP (or DUMP) tape, containing saved APL
workspaces, into segments in the working directory.  The segments are
given the name of the saved workspace, with the suffix "libN.sv.tsoapl"
added, where N is the library number of the workspace.


Syntax:  rtt tapename {filenames} {-control_arg}


Arguments:
tapename
   is the slot number of the tape

filenames
   are optional names of workspaces on the tape to be read.
   The default is to read in all workspaces.


Control arguments:
-attach_description XX, -atd XX
   Use XX as the attach description.  The default attach description is
   "tape_nstd_ tapename -bk 10000".

-density XX, -den XX
   Use XX as the density setting. XX must be 200, 556, 800, or 1600.
   The default is 1600.

-list, -ls
   List the names of the workspaces only. The default is to list
   and read the workspaces.


Note: The user must have rw permission on the segment >sc1>rcp>workspace.acs,
in order to get larger than normal tape buffers (tapes created by IBM APL have
10,000 byte records, which is larger than the default buffer size).

Since Multics permits only ASCII characters in segment names, any delta
characters in the workspace name are translated to "d", and any underlined
delta characters are translated to "D".

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
