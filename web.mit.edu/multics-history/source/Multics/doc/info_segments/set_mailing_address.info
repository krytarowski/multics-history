03/12/90  set_mailing_address, smla

Syntax as a command:  smla {address} {-control_args}


Function:  sets the user's preferred mailing address, which is used by
the mail system when mail is addressed to him by Person_id or alias
alone (i.e., "sdm Opus", instead of "sdm Opus.Bloom").  The user can
also indicate that his mailing address be reset to the default
(Person_id.default_Project_id).  For example, mail addressed to "Milo"
is sent to Milo.DProject, where "DProject" is Milo's default project at
the time the mail is sent.  Maintainers of other mail table entries can
also use this command to update those entries.


Arguments:
address
   can be any recipient address accepted by send_mail.  You can specify
   only one address.  It is incompatible with -dp.


Control arguments:
-default_project, -dp
   resets the mailing address using the default project.
-entry name
   specifies the entry whose mailing address is to be updated.  Enclose
   the name in quotes if it contains white space.  If name is an alias,
   its associated regular entry is updated.  You can use -entry only if
   you have rw access to the ACS segment associated with the entry.
   (Default:  your own entry)
-user address
   specifies the recipient address.  The address can be any address
   accepted by send_mail.  You can specify only one address.  Use
   -user in place of the address field if the address can be
   interpreted as a control argument.  It is incompatible with the
   -dp argument.


Notes:  Don't use -dp if the entry is not associated with a registered
user, since only users have default projects.  If you attempt this, an
error is reported.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
