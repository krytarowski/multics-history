11/24/86  create_mrds_dm_table, cmdmt

Syntax as a command:  cmdmt path {-control_args}


Function:  This command is a display tool which creates a pictorial
representation of a MRDS data base model/submodel.  Each box names an
attribute in the relation, giving its PL/I data type with flags
indicating if it is a key attribute and/or index attribute in the
relation.


Arguments:
path
   is the relative or absolute pathname of the data model/submodel of
   the data base, with or without the suffix.  The user must have "r"
   access to some relation in the data base.  The pathname must be the
   first argument.  If the data base is secured, then the path must
   refer to a submodel in the secure.submodels directory under the data
   base, unless the user is a DBA.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the PL/I data type information normally displayed below
   the attribute name inside each box.
-line_length N, -ll N
   specifies the maximum line length (in characters) available for the
   display of boxes across the page where 64<=N<=136).  (Default line
   length is 136)
-long, -lg
   causes the PL/I data type information to be displayed below each
   attribute name, inside each box.  (Default)

-order rel_name1 rel_name2 ...  rel_namei
   specifies that the displays generated for the relations whose names
   follow this argument are to be placed first in the output segment in
   the order of their names on the command line.  The displays for
   relations not named in the ordered list are placed at the end of the
   output segment in the order in which their names are defined in the
   data model.  The names following the -order control argument are
   separated by spaces.

-output_file filename, -of filename
    specifies the name to be assigned to the output segment.
-page_length N, -pl N
   specifies the number of lines allowed between new page characters in
   the output segment where 30<=N<=127.  (Default is 59 lines)
-relation rel_name1 rel_name2...relnamei,
     -rel rel_name1 rel_name2...relnamei
   specifies the names of relations for which the display is to be
   created.  The relations will appear in the output segment in the
   order specified.  The names following -rel are separated by spaces.
   The -rel control argument is incompatible with -order.
 

Notes:  The output is written to a segment whose name is constructed as
follows:

     <entryname of the input path with the db or dsm suffix
        removed>.table

   or, if -output_file is specified:
     
     <filename>.table

If the segment does not exist, it is created.

If both a data model and submodel of the same name are in the same
directory, then the model is found first if no suffix is given.

If the data base is secured and the user is not a DBA, then the key
head attribute is marked as "indexed" and remaining key attributes are
unmarked.


If a -decode_declare option exists on an attribute domain, then the
declaration appears in the table since this is the user view and the
data base storage data type is not of use.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
