84-07-19:  check_tc_data_size

Syntax:  check_tc_data_size {-control_args}


Function: displays the sizes of the Active Process Table (APT) and
Inter-process Transmission Table (ITT) that are allocated in the
tc_data segment.  The sizes of these data bases are controlled by the
values found on the TCD configuration card.  This command is useful to
determine if a proposed change to the TCD values will cause the
tc_data segment to become larger than 255 pages.  It is also useful to
help fill in the last page of the tc_data segment through manipulation
of either of the values on the TCD card.


Control arguments:
-apt N
   specifies that the APT is to have N entries.

-itt N
   specifies that the ITT is to have N entries.

-pathname STR, -pn STR
   specifies that the configuration deck with a pathname of STR is to
   be used.


Notes:
If either of the -apt or -itt control arguments are not used, a
configuration deck will be used to supply the missing values.

The configuration deck, if needed, is found with the user's search
rules if the -pathname option is not used in the command line.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
