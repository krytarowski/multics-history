Syntax as a command:  im {mbx_specification}


Function:  restores the immediate printing of interactive messages and
notifications.


Arguments:
mbx_specification
   specifies the mailbox on which the printing of messages is to be
   restored.  If not given, the user's default mailbox
   (>udd>Project>Person>Person.mbx) is used.


List of mbx specifications:
-log
   specifies the user's logbox and is equivalent to

      -mailbox >udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.sv.mbx
-mailbox path, -mbx path
   specifies the pathname of a mailbox.  The suffix .mbx is added if
   necessary.
-save path, -sv path
   specifies the pathname of a savebox.  The suffix .sv.mbx is added if
   necessary.
-user STR
   specifies either a user's default mailbox or an entry in the system
   mail table.
STR
   is any noncontrol argument and is first interpreted as -mailbox STR;
   if no mailbox is found, STR is then interpreted as -save STR; if no
   savebox is found, it is interpreted as -user STR.

options that may have been specified by accept_messages (see
accept_messages and print_messages).

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
