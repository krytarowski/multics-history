07/04/84  set_fortran_common, sfc

Syntax as a command:  sfc paths {-control_arg}


Function:  initializes common storage for a FORTRAN run.  Supply as an
argument every object file that is part of the FORTRAN run to ensure
that the common blocks are properly initialized.  This command allows
you to specify the files containing the block data subprograms prior
to the run.


Arguments:
paths
 is a list of pathnames of files containing block data subprograms
   that initialize common.


Control arguments:
-long, -lg
   prints a message if a referenced common block has already been
   allocated.


Notes:  This command is useful in the run exec_com, which initializes
the environment for a FORTRAN run.

Due to dynamic linking in Multics, if the first program to reference a
common block is not compiled or bound with the block data subprogram
that initializes the common block, this block may not be successfully
initialized.

Any common blocks referenced in the specified files are allocated
(if necessary) and initialized.  If no initialization information is
associated with the referenced common block, it is initialized to
binary zeroes.  If a common block was previously allocated, it is
effectively deleted and reinitialized.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
