10/20/86  retain_symbols, rsb

Syntax as a command:  rsb input_path {output_path} {-control_args}


Function:  takes an input text segment and inserts Speedtype escape
characters wherever symbols would be expanded if this text segment were
being processed by the expand_symbols command.  All symbols in the text
segment are thus retained during future expansion.


Arguments:
input_path
   is the pathname of the input text segment.
output_path
   is the optional pathname of an output text segment.  If no output
   pathname is specified, the original contents of the input text
   segment are overwritten.


Control arguments:
-perm
   specifies that the perm escape character is to be used.  (Default)
-temp
   specifies that the temp escape character is to be used.  Specifying
   this control argument causes the symbols in the output text segment
   to be retained for only one expansion.


Notes:  In addition to inserting the specified escape character
wherever necessary, all existing pad escapes are converted to the
specified escape.  This allows for more convenient editing of the input
text segment, since all escape characters are thus printable.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
