06/17/82  reconnect.ec

An exec_com segment, prepared by the user and stored in the home
directory, that is invoked automatically when the user connects to a
disconnected process.  It is often used to execute commands such as
set_tty, to ensure that terminal modes are what the user desires them
to be.


Notes:  When a terminal is disconnected, none of its modes, set by
default or by set_tty commands, are remembered.  This is because the
old modes may not be appropriate to the terminal which is used to
reconnect to the process.  Thus, if the user typically sets various
terminal modes in the start_up.ec, or by explicit command, it may be
helpful to make a reconnect.ec which also sets these modes.  For the
same reason that the system does not retain modes across process
disconnection, the user shoud not automatically set modes which may
conflict with the characteristics of any of the terminals which might
be used.  An example of a device-independent terminal characteristic
which the user might choose to alter are the line editing characters.
The start_up.ec and reconnect.ec might both contain a set_tty command
to change the line editing (erase and kill) characters.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
