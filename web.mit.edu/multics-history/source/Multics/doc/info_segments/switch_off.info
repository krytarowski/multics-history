05/13/88  switch_off, swf

Syntax as a command:  swf keyword paths {-control_args}


Function:  turns off a specified switch for one or more
entries--directory, segment, multisegment file (MSF), data management
(DM) file, and extended entry.  For an MSF, the switch of the MSF
directory (when possible) and those of all the components are turned
off.


Arguments:
keyword
   specifies the name of a switch (see "List of Keywords" below).
paths
   are the pathnames of entries for which it is possible to set the
   specified switch.  You can use the star convention, which includes
   links only if you give -chase.  You can specify by "-name STR" a
   pathname that looks like a control argument or contains starname
   special characters not meant to be matched.


Control arguments:
-chase
   includes links and chases them when you use the star convention.
-interpret_as_extended_entry, -inaee
   interprets the selected entry as an extended entry type.
-interpret_as_standard_entry, -inase
   interprets the selected entry as a standard entry type.
-name STR, -nm STR
   specifies a pathname that looks like a control argument or contains
   starname special characters not meant to be matched.
-no_chase
   does not include links when you use the star convention.  (Default)


List of keywords:
audit
   if ON, all accesses (successful or unsuccessful) of the entry will
   be audited.
copy_switch, csw
   if ON, allows processes lacking write access to modify a copy of the
   segment in the process directory.  (Segments)
complete_volume_dump_switch, cvds
   if ON, the entry is dumped during a complete volume dump of the
   physical volume on which it resides.
damaged_switch, dsw
   if ON, the segment is assumed to have been damaged by a device error
   or system crash.  (Segments)


incremental_volume_dump_switch, ivds
   if ON, the entry is dumped during an incremental dump cycle of the
   volume dumper.
perprocess_static_switch, ppsw
   if ON, the segment's internal static storage is not initialized when
   a run unit is created.  (Object segment)
safety_switch, ssw
   if ON, the delete command and delete_ subroutine query you before
   deleting the entry.
synchronized_switch
   if ON, writes out to disk the segment's pages only after
   corresponding pages in an associated before journal are written out.
   Only authorized users can set this switch.  (Segments)


Access required:  You require modify permission on the parent
directory.  Setting the audit switch requires access to the
system_privilege_ gate.


Notes:  The keywords can also include switches defined for particular
extended entry types (see describe_entry_type).

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
