Syntax:  .ifi l0toc "title"


Function:
These macros add a section or paragraph title to the Table of Contents
at the appropriate level.


Arguments:
'title' is the section-title or paragraph-title exactly as it is to
   appear in the Table of Contents.


Notes:
1) These macros are used to generate entries in the Table of Contents
   when, for any reason (such as the use of the equivalent 'exact'
   macro), the accompanying section or paragraph heading is not wanted
   in the text.  They may also be used to generate entries for sections
   as yet unwritten or to be provided.	The macros should be inserted
   immediately AFTER the title is placed in the text, or inserted where
   the unwritten section or paragraph belongs.


Examples:
A paragraph describing the qedx editor might begin:

        .ifi l3exact "USING THE qedx COMMAND"
        .ifi l3toc "Using the qedx Command"

(END)

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
