10/17/84  resource_usage, ru

Syntax as a command:  ru {-control_arg}


Function:  prints a month-to-date report of your resource consumption.


Control arguments:
   are used to select portions of the available resource usage
   information.  You can give only one of the following:
-brief, -bf
   prints a header describing the resource usage reporting period,
   followed by the month-to-date dollar charge, the monthly spending
   dollar limit, and three dollar-totals figures giving your
   interactive, absentee, and I/O daemon usage.
-long, -lg
   prints the most comprehensive picture of your resource usage.  In
   addition to including the information selected by -brief, it gives
   an expanded report of interactive, absentee, I/O daemon, and device
   usage.


      For interactive usage, the dollar charge is broken down according
   to shift, monthly dollar limit per shift, charged virtual CPU time,
   charged terminal connect time, and charged memory units expressed in
   thousands.  Absentee usage is presented giving usage per queue:
   number of dprint/dpunch requested pieces, charged virtual CPU time,
   and charged lines of printed or punched output.
      The device usage category includes charges for tape (time spent
   with a drive assigned), tape mounts, disk (time spent with a disk
   drive assigned), disk mounts, and logical volumes (time spent with a
   private logical volume attached).  In addition, a site can define
   devices corresponding to the various lines (tty or network) by which
   the system is accessed and set prices for their usage.


-total, -tt
   prints your dollar-totals figures for the month-to-date dollar
   charge, the monthly spending dollar limit, and the absolute total
   spending.
      If the project administrator has set an absolute dollar limit for
   you (which is independent of the monthly spending limit), it is
   printed, along with the date on which the limit was last reset and
   the limit's reset interval.  The absolute total spending is the
   dollar charge against this absolute limit.  In cases where no
   absolute limit has been set, the absolute total spending represents
   charges running from your registration date.


Notes:  If you supply no control argument, the default selects slightly
less resource usage information than that printed by -long.

The system calculates your month-to-date dollar charges when it creates
your process.  Issue the new_proc command prior to typing
resource_usage if you wish the most updated figures.

In a given usage report, shift and queue numbers may not appear in
consecutive order because only shifts or queues with accrued charges
are listed.


If no dollar limit stop has been set by your project administrator, the
resource usage report prints "open" as the dollar limit entry.

You can't invoke resource_usage to obtain information about another's
resource consumption.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
