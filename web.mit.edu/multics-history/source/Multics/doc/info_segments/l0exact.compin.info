Syntax:  .ifi l0exact "section-title"


Function:
This compose macro performs part of the functions of l0h.  It
1) initializes a new section of the manual
2) generates a section heading on a new page without translating the
   section-title into the Level 0 font
3) does NOT generate an entry in the Table of Contents

It is used when a section-title contains a literal string which must be
kept 'as is'.  It should be inserted at the beginning of a section of
the document.


Arguments:
'section-title' is the title of the section, exactly as it is to appear
   in the section heading.


Notes:
Use the l0toc macro to put the section title in the Table of Contents.


Examples:
A section on the exec_com control language could begin with
        .ifi init
        .srv section 1
        .ifi l0exact "THE exec_com CONTROL LANGUAGE"
        .ifi l0toc "The exec_com Control Language"

which yields (in typed output)

			 SECTION 1

		 THE exec_com CONTROL LANGUAGE

(END)

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
