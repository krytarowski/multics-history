02/05/85  format_string, fstr

Syntax as a command:  fstr {-control_args} text


Syntax as an active function:  [fstr {-control_args} text]


Function: uses format_document_$string to fill and optionally adjust a
text string.  As a command, it prints the filled and adjusted text; as
an active function, it requotes the return value.


Arguments:
text
   is the text strings to be filled.  If you give more than one, they
   are concatenated, separated by a space.  All arguments that do not
   begin with a minus and are not an operand of a preceding control
   argument are treated as text strings, and so are all arguments
   following the first text string encountered, whether or not they
   begin with a minus.


Control arguments:
-adjust, -adj
   left- and right-justifies text.
-break_word
   to prevent line length from being exceeded, arbitrarily breaks into
   two or more parts words that are longer than the current line length
   and that cannot be hyphenated (when you use -hyphenate).  (Default)
-column N, -col N
   formats text as if N-1 characters already appeared on the first
   line.  The output begins at column N.  (Default: 1)
-hyphenate {N}, -hph {N}
   changes the default hyphenation mode from OFF to ON.  The optional
   parameter N is the length of the smallest separated word part; its
   default value is 2.


-indent N, -ind N
   indents output N spaces from the left margin.  (Default: 0)
-line_length N, -ll N
   sets the line length to N characters.  (Default: 65)
-no_adjust, -nadj
   turns off justification.  (Default)
-no_break_word
   does not brake words longer than the line length; instead, it
   returns a line longer than the given line length.
-no_hyphenate, -nhph
   turns off hyphenation.  (Default)


-string text, -str text
   treats all remaining arguments as part of the text to be formatted.
-undent N, -und N
   undents the first line by N characters.  If N is negative, the first
   line is indented (with respect to the -indent value) by N
   characters.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
