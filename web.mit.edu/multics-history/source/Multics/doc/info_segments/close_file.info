02/06/85  close_file, cf

Syntax as a command:  cf {-control_arg} filenames


Function: closes specified FORTRAN, Pascal, and PL/I files.  It closes
all open FORTRAN, Pascal, and PL/I files if you give -all.


Arguments:
filenames
   are the names of open FORTRAN, Pascal, or PL/I files.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   closes all open files.  In this case, no filename appears.


Notes: The format of a FORTRAN file name is fileNN, where NN is a
two-digit number other than 00; e.g., file05.  PL/I and Pascal file
names are selected by you and can have any format.

If a specified file cannot be found, an error message is printed
indicating the name of the file.  The rest of the specified files are
closed.

For each filename, all PL/I and Pascal files of that name and, if
applicable, the FORTRAN file of that name are closed.

The command "close_file -all" does not affect I/O switches that are not
associated with FORTRAN, Pascal, or PL/I files.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
