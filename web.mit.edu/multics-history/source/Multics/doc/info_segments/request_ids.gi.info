07/20/78  Request IDs

Request IDs are used to identify absentee, I/O daemon, and retrieval requests,
when using the commands that list, cancel, or move those requests.


Request ID format: A request ID is a decimal number based on the date and time
the request was originally entered. A long request ID is a 19-digit number of
the form: yymmddHHMMSS.UUUUUU, giving the year, month, day, hour, minute,
second, and 6-digit fractional second (i.e., number of microseconds) at which
the request was entered. It is expressed in GMT rather than local time, to
avoid having the IDs of all existing requests change twice a year at the
transition to or from daylight time.  A short request id is the "HHMMSS"
portion of the long ID. It is often sufficient to uniquely identify a request.
Commands that print request IDs print the short ID by default, and accept the
-long_id (-lgid) control argument as a request to print the long ID instead.


Request ID matching: The request listing, moving, and cancelling commands will
accept an ID argument of any length (with a decimal point being assumed to the
right of the last digit of none is given).  A request is considered to match
an ID argument if the digits of the ID argument are equal to the corresponding
digits of the request ID. Thus, more than one request can match an ID
argument.  The request moving and cancelling commands require than an ID
argument be long enough to uniquely identify a single request. The request
listing commands will list all requests matching an ID argument.

car -id .1;lar -lgid

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
