03/06/85  forum_add_project, fapj

Syntax as a command:  fapj meeting_name Project_id {-control_args}


Function:  makes users from the project identified by Project_id
eligible to attend the meeting_name meeting.


Arguments:
meeting_name
   is the pathname or entryname of the meeting to be adjusted.
   Pathnames contain greater-than (>) or less-than (<) characters.  If
   a pathname is specified, it identifies the meeting to be adjusted.
   Otherwise, fapj searches for the meeting_name by using the forum
   search list.
Project_id
   is the Project_id for the project to be admitted to the meeting.


Control arguments:
-chairman, -cm
   gives chairman access to the added participant.  This control
   argument is not valid for meetings created with pre-MR11 software.
-read_only, -ro
   allows users on the added project to read transactions but not enter
   them.


Access required:  You can use this request if you have either modify
permision on the containing directory or chairman access to the
meeting.


Notes:  The -read_only and -chairman control arguments cannot both be
specified.

To change the access of a project to read only, use the fapj command
with the -read_only control argument to add the project again.  This
changes the original access to allow users on the project to read
transacrions but not enter them.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
