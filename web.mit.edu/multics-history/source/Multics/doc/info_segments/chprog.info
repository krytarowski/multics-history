02/06/84  chprog

Syntax:  chprog Person_id {prog_no}


Function: allows the accounting administrator to change the programmer
number for a user.  The programmer number must be all numeric and
can be up to sixteen characters long.  (Some installations use the
employee number assigned by the company in this field.) If the new
programmer number is not supplied, the old value is displayed and a
change is accepted.


Arguments:
Person_id
   is the Person_id of the user whose programmer number is to be
   changed.
prog_no
   is the new programmer number.  If this argument is omitted, the
   chprog command prints the old programmer number and then waits for
   the accounting administrator to either enter the new programmer
   number or a null line (to retain the old number).

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
