10/02/81	compile_gdt


Syntax:  compile_gdt segname {-control_args}


Function:  causes a segment containing the source of a Graphics
Device Table (GCT) to be compiled.


Arguments:
segname
   is the name of a segment containing the source of a GDT.  The
   suffix .gdt is assumed if not specified.


Control arguments:
-check, -ck
   specifies that the ALM assembler is not to be invoked, and that
   the intermediate assembler source file is to be retained.
-list, -ls
   specifies that the ALM assembler is to produce a listing of the
   GDT it creates.


Notes: A GDT source segment is conventionally named with the name of
the graphic terminal it describes, with th suffix ".gdt".  The
compile_gdt command compiles a GDT source segment into an assembly
language source segment.  The Multics ALM assembler is then invoked
internally to assemble this intermediate segment into a GDT.  The
final segment produced has the name of the source segment without the
suffix ".gdt".

For a description of Graphic Device Tables, see the Multics
Graphics System,. Order No. AS40.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
