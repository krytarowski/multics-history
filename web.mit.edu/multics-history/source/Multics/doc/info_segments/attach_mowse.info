01/09/87   attach_mowse, atm


Syntax:  attach_mowse {-control_args}, atm {-control_args}


Function:
Enters the MOWSE environment.  Sends a message to the PC requesting
that it enter the complete MOWSE environment (i.e.  accept MOWSE
messages).  On Multics, moves the attachment of the specified switch
to a mowse_i/o switch.  Attaches the first switch via mowse_i/o to
the second.


Control arguments:
-debug {path}
   Enables packet recording.  Writes all incoming and outgoing packets
   to the specified file, defaults to [wd]>debug.mowse_io_
-no_debug
   Disables packet recording.  (DEFAULT)
-trace {path}
   Enables tracing of Multics application messages by writing them to a
   Multics segment. (DEFAULT -- trace.mowse_io_)
-no_trace
   Disables tracing of Multics application messages. (DEFAULT)


-force, -fc
   Forces the mowse_i/o attachment irregardless of terminal type.
-no_force, -nfc
   Does not force the mowse_i/o attachment thus requiring the terminal
   type setting "MOWSE".   (DEFAULT)
-io_switch {switchname}, -iosw {switchname}
   Specifies the switch for the MOWSE environment.  (DEFAULT -- tty_
   -login_channel)


-start_up {entryname}, -su {entryname}
   Specifies which capabilities (if any) are to be loaded at the
   initialization of MOWSE on Multics.
-no_start_up, -nsu
   Does not allow start_up. (DEFAULT)


-escape N, -esc N
   Specifies that the N character (given as an octal value) is to be
   escaped when transmitted to the PC.
-network, -net
   Specifies that a network has been used in order to connect to
   Multics.  This forces end of packet (EOP) characters to be
   altered such that Multics sees transmits the EOP as a <CR>
   and receives the EOP as a <LF>.  This argument must be used
   ONLY if the MOWSE /N control_arg has been used to invoke
   MOWSE on the PC.


Notes:
The MOWSE environment provides a special connection between a
Multics process and a Personal Computer.  To enter the MOWSE
environment on Multics, the corresponding environment must have
been previously entered on the PC.  To establish the MOWSE
environment, the user must:

   1. First enter the MOWSE environment on the PC
   2. Connect to Multics.
   3. Invoke MOWSE on Multics. (atm)

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
