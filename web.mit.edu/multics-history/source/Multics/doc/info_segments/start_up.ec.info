03/15/74  start_up.ec

 A user can specify that a set of commands be executed when a process is
initialized, i.e. after a login, new_proc, or process termination.
The commands are specified as an exec_com segment in the user's initial working
directory with the name start_up.ec. If the segment start_up.ec exists in the
user's initial working directory, the printing of the message of the day
is suppressed and exec_com is called to execute the commands specified in the
segment. The call to exec_com is issued as the first command to the new process
before any lines are read from the terminal. The call to exec_com is issued
as the command:
    exec_com start_up CREATION_TYPE PROCESS_TYPE


Arguments:
    CREATION_TYPE is the string "login" if the process has been created as the
result of a login and is the string "new_proc" if the process has been created
as the result of a new_proc command or process termination.
    PROCESS_TYPE is the string "interactive" if the process being initialized is
an interactive one, and is the string "absentee" if the process is an absentee
process.
  To print the message-of-the-day, the command "help motd" can be issued from
the exec_com.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
