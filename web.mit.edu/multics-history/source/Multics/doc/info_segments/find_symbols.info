07/16/84  find_symbols, fsb

Syntax as a command:  fsb {expansions} {-control_args}


Function:  The find_symbols command finds and lists all of the symbols
associated with specified expansions contained in the current symbol
dictionary.  One, several, or all expansions may be listed.


Arguments:
expansions
   are optional arguments that specify expansions to find and list.  If
   an expansion is represented by more than one symbol, all of its
   symbols are found and listed.  If any given expansion is not found,
   a message is printed stating that the expansion is not defined.  If
   no expansions are specified, all expansions in the current symbol
   dictionary are listed.  The expansions are listed in order according
   to ASCII collating sequence.


Control arguments:
-long, -lg
   specifies that for each symbol listed, its expansion string with
   suffixing is listed for each suffix enabled for that symbol.
-option, -op
   specifies that all option information for the current symbol
   dictionary is to be listed (see the option_symbols command for a
   complete description of option information).  If this is the only
   control argument specified, only the option information is listed.
-total, -tt
   specifies that the total number of symbols defined in the current
   symbol dictionary is to be printed.  If this is the only control
   argument specified, only the total is printed.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
