01/30/84  bind_fnp

Syntax:  bind_fnp pathname {-control_args}


Function:  produces a core image segment that can be loaded into the
FNP.  It uses two control segments:  a bindfile, which specifies the
configuration that the FNP will support, the names and ordering of the
object segments included in the core image, and the size of certain
software tables; and an optional search rules segment, which specifies
which directories are searched to find the object segments.


Arguments:
pathname
   specifies the pathname of the bindfile.  If pathname does not have a
   suffix of bind_fnp, one is assumed.


Control arguments:
-cross_ref, -cref
   adds a symbol cross reference to the listing segment.  If -cross_ref
   is specified, the listing is generated regardless of whether -list
   is also specified.
-list, -ls
   produces a listing segment whose name is derived from the name of
   the bindfile, with the suffix changed to list.  The listing segment
   is a record of the binding.  It contains a copy of the bindfile, a
   load map, and any error messages generated during binding.


-search, -se
   indicates that the user wishes to specify the rules used to search
   for Multics Communications System object segments being bound into
   the core image.  If given, there must be a segment in the working
   directory containing an ASCII list of relative pathnames of
   directories to be searched in the order in which the search is
   desired.  By default, the working directory is searched.  This
   segment must have the same entryname as the bindfile, but with the
   suffix changed to search.
-version STR
   assigns a version of STR to the core image.  The maximum length of
   STR is four characters.  If this control argument is given, it
   overrides the version keyword specified in the bindfile.


Notes:  A default bindfile is supplied with the system.  In general,
the only fields that a site administrator would change are:  hsla,
lsla, version, order, and the size keyword for the trace module.

When creating a new FNP core image, object segments that are unchanged
must be extracted from the object archive (see the MPM Commands) into a
directory in the search list before executing the bind_fnp command.

The syntax of the bindfile is described in Section 6 of the MAM --
Communications Manual, Order No.  CC75.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
