02/17/84  truncate_heals_log

Syntax:  truncate_heals_log N
       or
         truncate_heals_log {-control_args}


Function:  deletes records from >system_control_1>heals_dir>heals_log.
It is used with the update_heals_log command.


Arguments:
N
   is the number of days, counted back from the current time, for which
   messages are to remain in the HEALS log.


Control arguments:
-from DT, -fm DT
   starts deleting messages from the specified date/time.  If omitted,
   a clock value of 0 is assumed; that is, the truncate_heals_log
   command starts deleting messages from the beginning of the log.
-to DT
   stops deleting messages from the specified date/time.  If omitted, a
   clock value equal to the current time is assumed.


Notes:  You must have rw access to the heals_log and heals_log_info
segments, both located in >system_control_1>heals_dir, in order to
delete messages from the HEALS log.

The date/times following the control arguments must be in a form
acceptable to convert_date_to_binary_ (see the Subroutines manual).

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
