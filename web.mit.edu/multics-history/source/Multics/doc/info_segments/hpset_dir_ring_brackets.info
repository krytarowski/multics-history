09/10/87  hpset_dir_ring_brackets, hpsdrb

Syntax:  hpsdrb path {optional_args}


Function: allows system administrators to modify the ring brackets of
any directory, including directories whose ring brackets are 0,0.
This command operates on directories whose ring brackets prevent them
from being operated on by the set_dir_ring_brackets command.  To use
this command, a system administrator must have access to the highly
privileged gate hphcs_.


Arguments:
path
   is the relative or absolute pathname of the directory whose ring
   brackets are to be modified.
rb1
   is the number to be used as the first ring bracket of the directory.
   See "Notes" below.
rb2
   is the number to be used as the second ring bracket of the
   directory.  See "Notes" below.


Notes:  If rb2 is omitted, the ring bracket is set to rb1.  If rb1 and
rb2 are omitted, they are set to the user's current validation level.
The ring brackets must be in the allowable range 0 through 7 and must
have the ordering: rb1 < rb2.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
