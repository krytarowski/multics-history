06/04/76  Logical Volumes

A logical volume is one or more disk volumes that contain segments.
Storage is allocated on logical volumes according to the following rules--
  1. segments immediately inferior to a directory reside on the same logical
volume;
  2. the logical volume on which inferior segments of a directory reside is set
when the directory is created;
  3. the logical volume of a new directory is the same as its parent unless a
master dir is created (type "help create_dir" and "help master_directories").


Segments are available when the logical volume on which they reside is
mounted. The root logical volume, containing all directories in the storage
hierarchy, is always mounted. Other logical volumes are mounted and demounted
by the operator at user's request (Type "help lv_attaching").


Registration record of logical volume contains:
  1. list of disk volumes comprising it.
  2. owner ID
  3. public or private switch.
  4. list of users with quota accounts.
  5. list of master directories.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
