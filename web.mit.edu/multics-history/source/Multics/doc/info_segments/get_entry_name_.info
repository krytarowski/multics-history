:Entry: get_entry_name_: 02/02/84  get_entry_name_


Function: given a pointer to an externally defined location or entry
point in a segment, returns the associated name.


Syntax:
declare get_entry_name_ entry (ptr, char(*), fixed bin(18), char(8)
     aligned, fixed bin(35));
call get_entry_name_ (entry_ptr, symbolname, segno, lang, code);


Arguments:
entry_ptr
   is a pointer to a procedure entry point.  (Input)
symbolname
   is the name corresponding to the location specified by entry_ptr.
   The maximum length is 256 characters.  (Output)
segno
   is the segment number of the object segment where symbolname is
   found.  It is useful when entry_ptr does not point to a text
   section.  (Output)
lang
   is the language in which the segment or component pointed to by
   entry_ptr was compiled.  (Output)

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
