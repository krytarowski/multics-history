06/22/79  run

Syntax:  run {-control_args} {main_program} {program_args}


Function: provides temporary environment for execution of programs.


Arguments: 
main_program
   pathname of the main program for the run.
program_args
   arguments passed to the exec_com or main program.


Control arguments: 
-exec_com path, -ec path
   specifies the exec_com to be executed.
-no_exec_com, -nec
   invokes the main program directly.
-limit n, -li n
   interrupts run every n seconds of virtual CPU time.
-copy_reference_names, -crn
   starts run with copy of reference names initiated before run and
   automatically terminates segments initiated only with the run unit.
-new_reference_names, -nrn
   uses a different reference name table and automatically terminates
   segments initiated only within the run unit. (DEFAULT)
-old_reference_names, -orn
   uses original reference name table directly and does not automatically
   terminate segments initiated during the run unit.


Notes: 
    -crn, -nrn, and -orn are mutually exclusive.
    If neither -exec_com nor -no_exec_com control arguments are given, the
exec_com segment main_program.run.ec is searched for in the same directory as
the main program. If it is not found, the main program is invoked directly.
    When an exec_com is used, the main program name, if any, is passed as the
first argument and the exec_com is responsible for invoking the main program.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
