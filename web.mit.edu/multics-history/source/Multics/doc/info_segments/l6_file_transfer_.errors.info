Known errors in the current release of l6_file_transfer_.

Description

4  phx18647
The TRAN protocol over PVE, while not clearly documented anywhere,
seems to require a "$*$DIS" character string to terminate the transfer
from host to DPS6.  See the TR for the code location to be changed.

3  phx18646
The DPS6 is not very fast, and the PVE protocol is not very robust, so
l6_ftf_ should delay at certain points in its dialogue with the DPS6.
In particular, after sending the positive ack, and before the first
prompt for a transfer from the DPS6 to Multics.  See the TR for the
location in the code.

2  phx11874
l6_ftf does not correctly handle files which do not end in a newline,
e.g.  they end in a formfeed.  Also, error messages should be printed
rather than error table numbers.

1  phx08618
There seems to be a problem in the polled vip multiplexer which causes
l6_ftf to have problems with transferring large files.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
