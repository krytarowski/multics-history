01/27/84  cv_pmf

Syntax:  cv_pmf pmf_path {-control_args}


Function:  converts an ASCII project master file (PMF) into a binary
project definition table (PDT).


Arguments:
pmf_path
   is the pathname of the PMF.  If path does not have a suffix of pmf,
   one is assumed; however, the suffix pmf must be the last component
   of the name of the source.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   prints error messages in the short format.
-long, -lg
   prints error messages in the long format.
-severity N, -sv N
   causes error messages whose severity is less than N (where N is 0,
   1, 2, 3, or 4) not to be written to the user_output switch.  If not
   specified, a severity level of 0 is assumed; i.e., all error
   messages are written to the user_output switch.


Notes:  The PMF is described in Section 3 of the MAM -- Project
Adminstrator Manual, Order No.  AK51, "Project Master File."  The newly
converted PDT is placed in the current working directory.  The
entryname of the new PDT is the same as the entryname of its source
PMF, with the pmf suffix replaced by pdt.  This command associates the
following severity values to be used by the severity active function:

   Value     Meaning

      0      No compilation yet or no error.
      1      Warning.
      2      Correctable error.
      3      Fatal error.
      4      Unrecoverable error.
      5      Could not find source.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
