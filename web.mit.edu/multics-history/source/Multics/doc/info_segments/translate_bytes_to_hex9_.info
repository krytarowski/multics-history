:Entry: translate_bytes_to_hex9_: 06/26/86  translate_bytes_to_hex9_

Function: translates a bit string to a character string
containing the hexadecimal representation of the bits.
Each 9-bit byte of the input is translated into two hex
digits by using the low-order 8 bits in each byte.


Syntax:
declare translate_bytes_to_hex9_ entry (bit (*), char (*));
call translate_bytes_to_hex9_ (bit_string, hex_string);


Arguments:
bit_string
   is the bit string to be translated.  This argument must start on a
   byte boundary and should be a multiple of 9 bit long.  Any extra
   bits, not part of a complete byte, are ignored.  (Input)
hex_string

   is the output character string containing hexadecimal digits
   obtained by translating the low order 8 bits of each 9-bit byte of
   the input string into 2 hex digits.  If the output string argument
   is longer than necessary, then it is filled with ASCII "0"
   characters.  (Output)


Notes:  This subroutine uses the hardware mvt instruction with a desc4a
descriptor for the input string and a desc9a descriptor for the output
string to do the translation.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
