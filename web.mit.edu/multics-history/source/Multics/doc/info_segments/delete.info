01/23/86  delete, dl

Syntax as a command:  dl {paths} {-control_args}


Function: deletes the specified segments, multisegment files (MSFs),
data management (DM) files, and/or extended entries.  Use delete_dir to
delete directories; use unlink to delete links.


Arguments:
paths
   are the pathnames of segments, MSFs, DM files, or extended entries.
   The star convention is allowed.


Control arguments:
-absolute_pathname, -absp
   prints the entire pathname of entries listed by -long, -query_all,
   and -query_each.
-brief, -bf
   does not print an error message if a segment, MSF, or DM file to be
   deleted is not found.
-chase
   deletes targets of links specified by paths as well as segments.
-entryname, -etnm
   prints only the entrynames of the entries listed by -long,
   -query_all, and -query_each, rather than the entire pathname.
   (Default)


-force, -fc
   deletes the specified entries, whether or not they are protected,
   without querying.
-interpret_as_extended_entry, -inaee
   interpret the selected entry as an extended entry type.
-interpret_as_standard_entry, -inase
   interpret the selected entry as a standard entry type.
-long, -lg
   prints a message of the form "Deleted file <path>" for each entry
   deleted.
-name STR, -nm STR
   specifies a nonstandard entryname STR (e.g., invalid star name such
   as **.**.compout or name containing <).
-no_chase
   does not delete targets of links.  (Default)


-query_all, -qya
   lists all segments to be deleted and queries whether they should be
   deleted or not.  Unless you give -force, an individual query is
   given for protected segments.
-query_each, -qye
   queries for every entry to be deleted, whether it is protected or
   not.  Protected segments are noted in the query.


Access required: You must have modify permission on the containing
directory.


Notes: You must supply at least one path or -name STR.

To delete a segment or MSF the entry must have both its safety switch
and its copy switch off.  If either is on, you are interrogated whether
to delete the entry.

You can't delete DM files if a transaction is still pending.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
