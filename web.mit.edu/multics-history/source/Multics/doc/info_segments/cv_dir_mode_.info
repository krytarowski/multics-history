:Entry:  cv_dir_mode_: 01/31/83  cv_dir_mode_


Function: converts a character string containing access modes for
directories into a bit string used by the ACL entries.


Syntax:
declare cv_dir_mode_ entry (char(*), bit(*), fixed bin(35));
call cv_dir_mode_ (char_modes, bit_modes, code);


Arguments:
char_modes
   are the character string access modes.  (Input)
bit_modes
   are the bit string access modes.  (Output)
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output) It can be:
   error_table_$bad_acl_mode
      if char_modes contains an invalid directory access mode character


Notes:
If char_modes is "null" or "n", bit_modes is set to "0"b.  The mode
characters in char_modes can occur in any order.  Spaces are ignored.
The following table indicates which bit in bit_modes is turned on when
the access mode character is found.

     Access Mode     Bit in bit_modes
     -----------     ----------------
          s                 1
          m                 2
          a                 3

These values are declared in access_mode_values.incl.pl1.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
