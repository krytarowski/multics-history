02/17/84	lisp_compiler, lcp

Syntax:  lcp {pathnames} {-control_args}


Function: converts a loadable ASCII segment containing lisp forms into
a standard Multics object segment that has the same effect when
loaded.  Such segments are loaded much more efficiently than their
ASCII counterparts, and further performance improvements are obtained
by compiling function definitions to eliminate interpretive overhead.


Arguments:
pathnames
   are pathnames of lisp source segments.  The ".lisp" suffix is
   assumed if not provided.  Output object segments are created in the
   working edirectory named as the source file name, with the ".lisp"
   suffix removed.


Control arguments:
-pathname PATH, -pn PATH
   takes PATH as the exact pathname of the source file.  No ".lisp" is
   appended, and the object segment name is the first component of the
   entryname of PATH.
-list, -ls
   creates an annotated listing of the source and object programs as
   "name.list" in the working directory.
-long, -lg
   when used with -list, generates a pseudoassembler listing of the
   object segment at the end of the listing file.
-check, -ck
   checks only for errors.  No object segment is produced.


-nowarn, -nw
   suppresses typing of warning messages.  Error messages of greater
   severity are still typed.
-times, -tm
   as each function is compiled, its name and the time taken to compile
   it are printed.
-total_time, -tt
   prints metering information at the end of the compilation.
-pedigree, -pdg
   prints bootstrap generation history of the compiler.  All other
   control arguments are then ignored.
-hold, -hd
   causes the compiler to remain in lisp when it finishes compiling,
   rather than returning to the caller of lisp_compiler.


-debug, -db
   sets up all the compiler's error handlers to be breakpoints, turns
   on all error checking, and pauses after pass one and pass two for
   each function.
-no_compile, -ncp
   does not compile function definitions contained in the file.  The
   compiler still produces an object segment that has had some basic
   syntax checking done and that is more efficient to load, but
   functions contained therein are in interpretable rather than
   compiled form.
-macros, -mc
   retains macro definitions at run time.


-all_special
   declares all variables special, usually for debugging.  The default
   is to make most variables local.  The behavior of local variables is
   slightly different from the behavior of variables in the
   interpreter.
-genprefix PREFIX, -gp PREFIX
   sets PREFIX to be the prefix used by the gensym function within the
   compiler's environment.  This may affect the results of macro
   expansion.
-eval FORM
   evaluates FORM in the compiler's environment before starting
   compilation.


Notes: The lisp compiler is a lisp program, and operates within the
lisp interpretive subsystem.  The handling of QUIT's during
compilation is similar to that of the lisp command.  Hitting QUIT
causes "CTRL/" to be printed.  The following responses (followed by a
newline) are of interest:

         	z	to QUIT
	0	print out name of function currently being compiled


The Multics LISP implementation is described in the MACLISP Reference
Manual.  Chapters 1-3 of the Revision 1 manual can be obtained from

   MIT Laboratory for Computer Science
     Publications, Room NE43-112
   545 Technology Square
   Cambridge, MA  02139

The current price of the manual is $4.00, plus postage and handling.


This manual describes most of the functions and features available (it
was never completed) with the exception of I/O and compilation.  These
facilities were described in the now out-of-print Revision 0 (1974) of
the manual.  All differences of the current implementation from this
manual and improvements made to this implementation are described in
the online documentation, listed below.  This includes a number of
very important facilities.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
