12/06/84 before_journal_meters, bjmt

Syntax:  bjmt {paths} {-control_args}


Function:  before_journal_meters gathers and organizes various data
from DM tables that serve to indicate the performance of the before
journal manager.  Information is provided summarizing system-wide
behavior and per-journal behavior.


Arguments:
paths
   are pathnames of before journals.  If the before journal suffix,
   .bj, is not present, it will be added by before_journal_meters.


Control arguments:
-reset, -rs
   suppresses reporting on the meters resets them to zero.
-report_reset, -rr
   reports on the meters and then resets them.
-brief, -bf
   selects the brief format for reporting on before journal usage.
   (DEFAULT)
-long, -lg
   selects the long format for reporting on before journal usage.  This
   includes a detailed breakdown of system-wide usage of each before
   journal manager operation.


Notes:  Some portions of the long report require re access to
dm_admin_gate_.  If the user does not have such access, as much
information as is available without it will be displayed.


Examples:  Following are two example invocations of this command.  The
first is the default output (the -brief format), the second is the long
output.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
