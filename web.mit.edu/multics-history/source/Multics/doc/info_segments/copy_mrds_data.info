06/16/86  copy_mrds_data, cpmd

Syntax:  cpmd input_db_path output_db_path {-control_args}


Function:  This command copies data from one MRDS data base to another.


Arguments:
input_db_path
   is the pathname of the data base from which data is copied.  If the
   pathname does not have a suffix of db, then one is assumed.
   However, the db suffix must be the last component of the name of
   the input segment.
output_db_path
   is the pathname of the data base to which date is copied.  The data
   base must already exist.  If the pathname does not have a suffix of
   db, then one is assumed.  However, the db suffix must be the last
   component of the name of the output segment.


Control arguments:
-input_prevent_ops OPS
   specifies the prevent scope on the input relation(s), where OPS is
   the set of operations that the user wishes to deny other openers of
   the input data base for the relation(s) being copied.  (Default is
   "dms" -- refer to Notes for a list of scope mode abbreviations.)
-output_prevent_ops OPS
   specifies the prevent scope on the output relation(s), where OPS is
   the set of operations that the user wishes to deny other openers of
   the output data base for the relation(s) being copied.  (Default is
   "dms" -- refer to Notes for a list of scope mode abbreviations.)


-relation RELNAME, -rel RELNAME
   specifies that RELNAME be copied.  Only one relation at a time can
   be copied using this control argument.  If this control argument
   appears more than once in a command line, the previous occurrence
   is overridden.
-transaction_group_size N
   specifies copying N tuples within the confines of a single
   transaction.  If this control argument is omitted, or if N is equal
   to 0, then each access to a protected data management file is
   completed as a separate transaction.


Notes:  The abbreviations used for prevent scope operations (for either
input or output) are as follows:
   a     append_tuple
   s     append_tuple (same as a)
   d     delete_tuple
   m     modify_attr
   n     null
   r     read_attr
   u     update (same as dms)


If "n" prevent scope is given, then no other mode may be specified for
that prevent.  Each of the other modes may be used only once in the
same prevent scope.


Relations that are copied must be identical in their makeup, having the
same attributes, attribute names, indexes, etc.  It is suggested, where
possible, that both data bases be created using the same create_mrds_db
source.  When using the -relation control argument however, it is
possible to copy from data bases with differing models, as long as the
relation being copied is the same in both data bases.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
