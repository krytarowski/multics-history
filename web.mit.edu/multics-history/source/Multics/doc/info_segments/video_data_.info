03/19/85  video_data_


The video_data_ subroutine is a data segment containing information
about the video system.


Entry points in video_data_:
   (List is generated by the help command)


:Entry:  terminal_iocb:  03/19/85 video_data_$terminal_iocb


Function:  This is the terminal control switch IOCB pointer.  If the
video system is activated for the user's terminal, this pointer is
nonnull, and points to the IOCB for the switch user_terminal_.


declare video_data_$terminal_iocb pointer external static;


Notes:
User programs may use this pointer for two purposes:

1. Inquiring as to whether the video system is activated, by checking
   to see if the pointer is null.

2. Determining the physical characteristics and capabilities of the
   terminal.  This may be accomplished with the get_capabilities
   control order, described under the window_io_ I/O module.  The
   height and width returned will be that of the physical terminal
   screen.

   No other manipulations of this switch are permitted.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
