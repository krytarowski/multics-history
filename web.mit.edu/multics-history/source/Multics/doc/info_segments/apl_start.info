Syntax:  apl_start {-control_args}


Function:	 Attaches APL I/O module so that all terminal I/O undergoes APL
translations.


Control arguments:
-terminal_type ID, -ttp ID
   sets terminal type to ID. Possible types are 1050, 2741, CORR2741, ARDS,
   TN300, TEK4013, TEK4015, 1030, TYPEPAIRED, BITPAIRED, ASCII, TELERAY11,
   LA36, SARA, AJ510, AJ830, AJ832.  The following terminals default to the
   correct table, if the type of the login terminal is set correctly:	 1050,
   2741, CORR2741, ARDS, TN300, TEK4013, TEK4015, TELERAY11, LA36, SARA, AJ510,
   AJ830, AJ832.  Multics terminal types that are not recognized by APL default
   to the ASCII table.  The following terminals are automatically switched into
   and out of APL mode:  TEK4013, TEK4015, TELERAY11, AJ510.  A 2741 is an EBCD
   2741.	A CORR2741 is a Correspondence 2741.  TYPEPAIRED is a generic
   terminal type for all typewriter-paired APL/ASCII terminals.  BITPAIRED is a
   generic terminal type for all bit-paired APL/ASCII terminals.


Notes:  This command is useful when preparing exec_com or absentee input
scripts that contain APL characters. It "turns on" the APL translations so that
the proper codes will be stored in the script for use by APL.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
