12/14/80  dot_fig.compin

Syntax:  .ifi dot_fig "figure-title"


Function:
This compose macro
1) increments the figure "dot number" counter
2) outputs a centered, perhaps multiline figure caption below the
   figure with appropriate spacing between figure and caption
3) adds the 'figure-title' to the list of Illustrations in the Table of
   Contents if the creation of such a list has been enabled (see
   fig_on.compin.info)


Arguments:
'figure-title' is the title of the figure, as it is to appear in the
   list of Illustrations in the Table of Contents (initial caps, no
   underlines).


Notes:
1) The figure "dot number" counter is maintained on a per-section basis
   for documents done in sections (those in which the 'section'
   variable has been set), and on a per-document basis for all other
   documents.
2) After the dot_fig macro is used, the 'figure' compose variable
   contains the figure number of the current figure.  'figure' will be
   of the form '<section>-<last_fig_no>.N' if the 'section' variable
   has been set.  'figure' can be used in the text to refer to the
   current figure.  (See dot_fig_get_no.compin.info and
   fig_get_no.compin.info for references to a figure other than the
   current figure.)
3) The dot_fig macro cannot be used without an existing <last_fig_no>,
   that is, it must follow some use of the fig or fig_index macros.
   The next use of the fig, fig_index, or fig_get_no macro resets the
   figure "dot number" counter back to zero.
4) See dot_fig_index.compin.info, fig_index.compin.info,
   dot_fig_get_no.compin.info, fig_get_no.compin.info, and
   fig_on.compin.info for related information.


Examples:
To add a Figure after Figure 3-3 of a document...
     .ifi dot_fig "Added Figure"
resulting in...

                      Figure 3-3.1.  Added Figure

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
