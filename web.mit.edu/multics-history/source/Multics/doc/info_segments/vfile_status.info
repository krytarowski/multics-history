10/17/84  vfile_status, vfs

Syntax as a command:  vfs path


Function: prints information about and the apparent type
(unstructured, sequential, blocked, or indexed) and length of files.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a segment or multisegment file.  If the entryname
   portion of a pathname denotes a directory, it is ignored.  If no
   files are found for the given pathname, a message is printed.  If
   the entry is a link, the information returned pertains to the entry
   to which the link points.  The star convention is allowed.


Notes: For structured files, information about the state of the file
(if busy) and the file version (unless current) is printed.  For
blocked files the maximum record length is printed.  For indexed files
the following statistics are printed:
   1. the number of records in the file, including zero-length records
   2. the number of nonnull records in the file, if different from the
      above
   3. the total length of the records (bytes)
   4. the number of blocks in the free-space list for records
   5. the height of the index tree (equal to zero for empty files)
   6. the number of nodes (each 1K words, page aligned) in the index
      tree


   7. the total length of all keys (bytes)
   8. the number of keys (if different from record count)
   9. the number of duplicate keys (if nonzero)
  10. the total length of duplicate keys (if any).

For additional information see the status command.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
