08/02/84  gcos_reformat_syslib, gcrs

Syntax as a command:  gcrs input_path {output_path} {record_length}


Function:
This command reformats the softw-syslib file (the library used by
GELOAD) from the total system tape, so that it can be read by the
simulator.


Arguments:
input_path
   is the pathname of the file pulled from a GCOS total systems tape.
   Typically, this is the file for "softw-syslib."
output_path
   is the pathname for the reformatted data.

   If output_path is not given, the modifications are made to the input
   file.  Since a temporary file is not used, quitting and releasing
   while updating the input file leaves the file in an inconsistent
   state, from which recovery is almost impossible.


record_length
   is the number of words from each input record to be written to the
   output file after the first data word of each input record is
   discarded.

   If record_length is not given, the default is 321.  Record_length is
   distinguished from output_path in that it must be numeric.  It may
   precede or follow output_path, and output_path need not be given
   when record_length is given.


Notes:  As read from the total system tape, the file contains 321-word
blocks.  The first is a block control word (BCW), and the next 320 make
up a block that GELOAD interprets itself.  The BCW of each block is
discarded, and the remaining 320-word blocks are packed together.  If
read from a 7-track tape, the word count is rounded up to the next even
number (322), so a word at the end must also be discarded.  The number
of words to be read is therefore an optional argument, with the default
being 321.  The first word is discarded, and the next 320 words are
always retained.

The first word (the BCW) is checked for sequential block serial numbers
(BSN), and block lengths of 320 words or fewer, to verify that the
correct record length was used for reading, and that the words being
discarded are really BCWs.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
