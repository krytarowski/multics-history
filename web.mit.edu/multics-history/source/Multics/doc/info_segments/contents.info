Syntax as a command: contents path {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [contents path {-control_args}]


Function: prints or returns the contents of a segment or archive
component as a character string.


Arguments:
path
   is an absolute or relative pathname to the segment or archive
   component to be processed.


Control arguments:
-exclude STRING, -ex STRING
   does not print lines containing STRING.  Exclusion is done after
   matching.  Thus, "-match A -exclude B" prints all lines with an A
   except those with a B.
-exclude /REGEXP/, -ex /REGEXP/
   does not print lines containing a string matching the regular
   expression REGEXP.  (See the qedx command for the definition of
   regular expressions.)
-from X, -fm X
   begins printing from the Xth line.  This control argument and -last
   are incompatible.  (Default: line 1)


-from /REGEXP/, -fm /REGEXP/
   begins with first line matching the regular expression REGEXP.
-match STRING
   prints only lines containing the character string STRING.
-match /REGEXP/
   prints only lines containing a string matching the regular
   expression REGEXP.
-newline, -nl
   leaves newline characters in the segment unchanged.
-no_newline, -nnl
   changes newline characters in the segment to blanks in the string.
   (default)
-requote_line, -rql
   requotes each line in the segment and changes newline characters in
   the segment to blanks.
-to N
   stops printing with line number N.  (Default: to print all lines)
-to /REGEXP/
   stops printing with the first line matching the regular expression
   REGEXP.  The search for REGEXP begins after the first line printed.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
