02/29/84  decode

Syntax:  decode path1A {path2A ... path1N path2N} {-control_args}


Function: reconstructs an original segment from an enciphered segment
according to a key that is not stored in the system.  The encode
command is used to encipher segments.


Arguments:
path1A
   is the pathname of an enciphered segment.  The code suffix should
   not be specified.  The star convention is allowed.
path2A
   is the pathname of the deciphered segment to be produced.  If the
   last path2 is not given, a pathname is constructed from path1.
   The equal convention is allowed.


Control arguments:
-key STR
   specifies the encipherment key STR on the command line and does not
   query for one. This control argument is useful in exec_com's for
   multiple invocations of the command with the same key.


Notes: This command requests the key from the terminal only once.  All
segments specified in an invocation of decode are deciphered with the
same key.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
