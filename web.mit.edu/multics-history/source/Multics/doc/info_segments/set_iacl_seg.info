01/14/87  set_iacl_seg, sis

Syntax as a command:  sis path mode1 {User_id1...modeN User_idN}
   {-control_args}


Function:  manipulates the segment initial access control lists
(initial ACLs) of directories.


Arguments:
path
   specifies the directory whose segment initial ACL is to be changed.
   If it is -working_directory (-wd), the segment initial ACL for the
   user's working directory is changed.  You can use the star
   convention.
modes
   is the mode associated with User_ids.  It can consist of any or all
   the letters rew.  The strings null, n, and "" specifically deny
   access to User_ids.
User_ids
   is an access control name of the form Person_id.Project_id.tag.  If
   one or more of the components is missing, all entries that match
   User_ids are changed to modes (see set_acl for a description of the
   matching strategy).  If the three components are present, the
   segment initial ACL entry with that name is changed to modes or one
   is added if none exists.


Control arguments:
-no_sysdaemon, -nsd
   does not add "rw *.SysDaemon.*" when using -replace.
-replace, -rp
   deletes all segment initial ACL terms--with the exception of the
   default *.SysDaemon.* term unless you supplied -no_sysdaemon--before
   adding the terms specified on the command line.  (Default:  to add
   to, and modify, the existing initial ACL)
-ring N, -rg N
   identifies the ring number whose segment initial ACL should be set.
   It can appear anywhere on the line, except between a mode and its
   associated User_id, and affects the whole line.  If present, follow
   it by N (where 0 <= N <= 7).  If omitted, your ring is assumed.
-sysdaemon, -sd
   adds, with -replace, an "rw *.SysDaemon.*" initial ACL term before
   adding the terms specified on the command line.  (Default)


Notes:  A segment initial ACL contains the ACL entries to be placed on
segments created in the specified directory (see "Access Control" in
the Programmer's Reference Manual).

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
