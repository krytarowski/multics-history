Syntax:  sg {-control_args}


Function:  Sets up the I/O switches for graphics input and output.


Control arguments:
-table gdt_name, -tb gdt_name
   specifies the graphic device table for the terminal or graphic device being
   used.  This control argument must be present except when -output_file is
   specified.
-output_file pathname, -of pathname
   routes graphic output to the file specified.  The file will contain Multics
   Graphics Code if -table is not supplied; otherwise it will contain graphics
   code for the device named.


-from switchname {open_mode}, -fm switchname {open_mode}
   specifies the I/O switches to be attached.  This control argument may occur
   multiple times.  The open_mode may be any opening mode accepted by the
   io_call command.  (DEFAULT-- -from graphic_output so -from graphic_input si)
-to switchname
   specifies the target switch to which the graphic switches are to be di-
   rected, through graphic_dim_.  (DEFAULT-- -to tty_i/o -online)


-online
   specifies that all other process I/O switches are to be routed through the
   graphic_dim_.  (DEFAULT for terminal-like devices.)
-offline
   is short for "-to offline_graphics_".
-modes mode_string
   specifies GDT or device modes to be applied (via iox_$changemode) to the
   switches named in the -from control arg(s).


Examples:
To set up graphics I/O to a Tektronix 4014 terminal, issue the command--

     sg -tb tek_4014

To use the CalComp 915/1036 offline plotter, issue--

     sg -tb calcomp_915 -offline


To route Multics Graphics Code into a file for later use, issue--

     sg -of save.graphics

To route alternate graphics I/O switches to a secondary ARDS terminal dialed to
the process, issue--

     sg -from graphic_output1 so -from graphic_input2 si -to dial_switch
          -table ards

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
