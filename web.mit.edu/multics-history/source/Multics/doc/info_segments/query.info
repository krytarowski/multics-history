Syntax as an active function:  [query arg {-control_args}]


Function:	 asks the user a question and returns the value true if the
user's answer to the question is "yes" or false if the user's answer is
"no"; if the user's answer is anything else, the query active function
prints a message asking for a "yes" or "no" answer.


Arguments:
arg
   is the question to be asked.  If the question contains spaces or
   other command language characters, it must be enclosed in quotes.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses extra spacing and newlines when asking questions.
-disable_cp_escape, -dcpe
   disables the ability to escape to the command processor via the ".."
   response.  See "Notes on command processor escape" below.
-enable_cp_escape, -ecpe
   enables the ability to escape to the command processor via the ".."
   response.  See "Notes on command processor escape" below.
-input_switch STR, -isw STR
   specifies the I/O switch to use for input of the user's response.
   The default is user_i/o.
-long, -lg
   adds a leading newline and three trailing spaces to the question.
   This is the default.


-no_trim
   do not trim trailing spaces from the question argument.
-output_switch STR, -osw STR
   specifies the I/O switch to use for output of the question to the
   user.	The default is user_i/o.
-repeat DT, -rp DT
   repeats the question every DT if the user has not responded where DT
   must be in a form suitable for input to the convert_date_to_binary_
   subroutine.
-trim
   trim trailing spaces from the question argument. (Default)


Notes:  The format_line active function can be used to insert other
active function values into the question.


Notes on command processor escape:  The -disable_cp_escape and
-enable_cp_escape control arguments override the system or subsystem
default.	The system default is "enabled".  Subsystems may define the
default to be either "enable" or "disable".  See the command_query_
subroutine for details.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
