08/18/83  print_bind_map, pbm

Syntax:  pbm path {components} {-control_args}


Function:  displays all or part of the bind map of an object segment
generated by version 4 or subsequent versions of the binder.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a bound object segment.
components
   are the optional names of one or more components of this bound
   object and/or the bindfile name.  Only the lines corresponding to
   these components are displayed.  A component name must contain one
   or more nonnumeric characters.  If it is purely numerical, it is
   assumed to be an octal offset within the bound segment, and the
   lines corresponding to the component residing at that offset are
   displayed.  A numerical component name can be specified by preceding
   it with -name.  If no component names are supplied, the entire bind
   map is displayed.


Control arguments:
-long, -lg
   prints the components' relocation values (also printed in the
   default brief mode), compilation times, and source languages.
-name STR, -nm STR
   is used to indicate that STR is really a component name, even though
   it appears to be an octal offset.
-no_header, -nhe
   omits all headers, printing only lines concerning the components
   themselves.
-page_offset, -pgofs
   causes the page number of the first word of the text section of each
   component to be printed as an octal number, which is the format used
   by the cumulative_page_trace command.  If the component crosses at
   least one page boundary, a plus (+) character follows the page
   number.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
