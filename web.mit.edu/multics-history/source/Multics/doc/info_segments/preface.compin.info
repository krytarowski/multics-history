11/30/86	preface.compin, pf.compin, pf_cont.compin

Syntax: .ifi preface "copyright-year(s)"
     OR .ifi pf	 "copyright-year(s)"
        .srv file_no "Pubs-catalog-file-number"
and, at the top of the second page (to reset the footers, etc.)  .ifi
        pf_cont


Function:
This compose macro creates a preface for a manual.  It
1) generates a 'Preface' section heading (with no Table of Contents
   entry)
2) generates the page footers for the first and succeeding pages of the
   preface (with a copyright notice and 'Pubs-catalog-file-number' on
   the first page)
3) numbers the Preface pages in lowercase roman, starting with 'iii'
4) adds a legal notice concerning specifications and availability of
   the described product.


5) generates a special notice on the Preface page (ahead of the
   copyright line) of all technical manuals advising the reader of
   possible changes in the information and availability of the
   product described.  This notice may not be typed for a typewritten
   manual, but must be pasted in before printing.  Preface.compin will
   leave one inch of extra space on the preface page to accommodate
   this notice.


Arguments:
'copyright-year(s)' is the copyright year(s) (all 4 digits) for the
   document.
'Pubs-catalog-file-number' is the file reference number given in the
   Publications Catalog.  (For Honeywell use, these numbers will be
   found in Table 1-3 in Part III, "Writing and Editing," of the
   Honeywell Publications Standards.)
'notice' is a specifications disclaimer legal notice will be
   printed at the bottom of the first preface page, ahead of the
   Copyright line.


Examples:
The following could be the preface of the MPM Commands:
        .ifi init_mpm "AG92"
        .srv file_no "1L13"
        .ifi preface "1975, 1977"
        	   Primary reference for user and
        	     .
        	     .
        	     .
        .brp
        .ifi pf_cont
        	   The MPM I/O manual
        	     .
        	     .

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
