Entry points in mhcs_:
   (List is generated by the help command)


:Entry:  get_seg_usage:  02/03/84 mhcs_$get_seg_usage


Function:  This entry point returns the number of page faults taken on
a segment since its creation.


Syntax:
declare mhcs_$get_seg_usage entry (char(*), char(*), fixed bin(35),
     fixed bin(35));
call mhcs_$get_seg_usage (dir_name, entryname, use, code);


Arguments:
dir_name
   is the directory containing the segment.  (Input)
entryname
   is the entry name of the segment.  (Input)
use
   is the page fault count.  (Output)
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output)


Notes:  This entry point works for segments only and cannot be used to
determine the page faults on a directory.


:Entry:  get_seg_usage_ptr:  02/03/84 mhcs_$get_seg_usage_ptr


Function:  This entry point works the same as mhcs_$get_seg_usage
except that it takes a pointer to the segment.


Syntax:
declare mhcs_$get_seg_usage_ptr entry (ptr, fixed bin(35),
     fixed bin(35));
call mhcs_$get_seg_usage_ptr (s_ptr, use, code);


Arguments:
s_ptr
   is a pointer to the segment.  (Input)
use
   is the page fault count.  (Output)
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output)

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
