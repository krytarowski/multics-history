:Entry:  get_temp_segment_:  09/25/86  get_temp_segment_


Function: acquires a temporary segment in the process directory.  The
segment returned to the caller is zero-length.

A free pool of temporary segments is associated with each user process.
The pool concept makes it possible to use the same temporary segment
more than once during the life of a process.  Reusing temporary
segments in this way avoids the cost of creating a segment each time
one is needed.

If more than one temporary segment is required, use the
get_temp_segments_ subroutine.


Syntax:
declare get_temp_segment_ entry (char(*), ptr, fixed bin(35));
call get_temp_segment_ (program, temp_seg_ptr, code);


Arguments:
program
   is a 32-character field identifying the program on whose behalf the
   temporary segment is to be used.  This field is displayed by the
   list_temp_segments command.  Besides giving the name of the command
   or subroutine invoked by the user, it can also briefly describe how
   the temporary segment is used; for example, "sort_seg (sort
   indexes)."  (Input)
temp_seg_ptr
   is a returned pointer to the requested temporary segment.  (Output)
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output)


Notes:  This subroutine assigns a temporary segment to its caller.  It
creates a new temporary segment and adds it to the free pool if one is
not currently available to satisfy the request.  The temporary segment
is created in the process directory with a unique name including the
temp.xxxx suffix, where xxxx is the segment number of the segment in
octal.  See the description of the release_temp_segment_ or the
release_temp_segments_ subroutine for a description of how to return a
temporary segment to the free pool.

The list_temp_segments command (described in the MPM Commands) can be
used to list the temporary segments being used by a process.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
