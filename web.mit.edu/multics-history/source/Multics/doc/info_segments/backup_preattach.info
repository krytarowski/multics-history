03/27/84  backup_preattach

Syntax:   backup_preattach open_mode attach_description
    or:   backup_preattach -detach


Function: attaches and detaches the I/O switch used by the backup_dump
and backup_load subsystems with a specified attach description, so
that input and output media or devices other than tapes may be used by
the backup subsystem.


Arguments:
open_mode
   is either "input" or "output", indicating the mode in which the
   switch will be opened (input for backup_load, output for
   backup_dump).
attach_description
   is an attach description for reading or writing the backup
   data. A switch with this attachment will be used by the backup
   subsystem.


Control arguments:
-detach
   Causes the previously pre-attached switch to be detached. The
   backup subsystem will revert to using tapes after -detach is
   specified.


Examples:  To create a vfile_ containing the image of a hierarchy and
then reload it somewhere else:
    backup_preattach output "vfile_ dump_file"
    backup_dump >udd>Project
    backup_preattach -detach
    backup_preattach input "vfile_ dump_file"
    backup_load

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
