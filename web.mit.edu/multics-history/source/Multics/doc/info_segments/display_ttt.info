02/10/88  display_ttt

Syntax as a command:  display_ttt {-control_args}


Function:  prints all or part of a terminal type table (TTT) on your
terminal or outputs it to a file.  The output's format is such that it
can be used as a terminal type file (TTF).


Control arguments:
-header, -he
   prints a header (see "Notes").
-no_header, -nhe
   suppresses printing of the header.
-output_file PATH, -of PATH
   directs output to the file whose pathname is PATH.  If the ".ttf"
   suffix is omitted from PATH,  it is added.  If PATH is omitted,
   output is directed to the terminal.


-pathname PATH, -pn PATH
   displays the TTT whose pathname is PATH.  If the ".ttt" suffix is
   omitted from PATH,  it is assumed.  If PATH is omitted,
   the process's current TTT is displayed.
-table NAME, -tb NAME
   displays only the conversion, translation, function keys, or special
   table named NAME (see "Notes").  The star convention is allowed and
   any entries matching the starname will be displayed.
-terminal_type NAME, -ttp NAME
   displays only the terminal type entry for the terminal type named
   NAME (see "Notes").  The star convention is allowed and any entries
   matching the starname will be displayed.


-expand, -exp
   expands any LIKE terminal type definitions back to the root
   definition.  This option is mutually exclusive with the -output_file
   option.


Notes:  If neither -terminal_type nor -table is given, the entire
contents of the TTT are displayed.  If -no_header is not selected, an
introductory comment is printed, giving the pathname of the TTT, the
date, and the User_id of the author of the original TTT.  If either
-terminal_type or -table is supplied, only the specified terminal type
entry or table is displayed, without the introductory comment unless
-header is also used.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
