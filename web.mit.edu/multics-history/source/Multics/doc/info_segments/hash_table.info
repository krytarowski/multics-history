02/13/85  hash_table, ht

Syntax as a command:  ht path nb


Function: used to create a hash table and to insert, delete, and
search for entries in it.  It uses the hash_ subroutine.


Arguments:
path
   specifies the name of a segment, which is an existing hash table.
nb
   is the (optional) number of buckets with which the hash table is to
   be created.  If you don't give nb or if it is out of range (0 < nb
   <= 6552), then a default is assigned to it.


List of requests: The command operates in response to the following
   requests given by you.  Each request code must be the first
   character of the line and followed by one or more arguments
   separated by any number of blanks (a blank before the first argument
   is optional).
a      add
d      delete
q      quit
s      search


Notes on the a request:


Syntax:  a name1 value1...nameN valueN


Function: inserts an entry into the hash table for namei and its
corresponding valuei.


Arguments:
namei
   is a character string less than, or equal to, 32 characters.
valuei
   is a decimal number you associate with namei to indicate its
   location in the corresponding data table.  It can be array
   subscript.


Notes on the d request:


Syntax:  d name1...nameN


Function: deletes the entry namei from the hash table and prints the
value it was associated with.


Arguments:
namei
   is a character string less than, or equal to, 32 characters.


Notes on the q request:


Syntax:  q


Function: returns control to command level.


Notes on the s request:


Syntax:  s name1...nameN


Function: searches the hash table for namei and prints its
corresponding value.  You can then locate namei in your data table by
using valuei.


Arguments:
namei
   is a character string less than, or equal to, 32 characters.


Notes: If the hash table ever becomes full or inefficient, the number
of buckets is doubled or assigned the maximum, the hash table is
rehashed, and a message is printed.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
