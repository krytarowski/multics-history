10/20/86 add_symbols, asb

Syntax as a command:  asb symbol expansion {-control_args}


Function:  adds a symbol to the current symbol
dictionary.  All suffixes are enabled for the added symbol.


Arguments:
symbol
   is the symbol to be added.  Its length must be 7 characters or less
   and it may not contain delimiter characters.  Its first character
   may not be a defined prefix character or a capital letter, and its
   last character may not be a defined suffix character or a period.
expansion
   is the expansion string that replaces the symbol.  The length of the
   expansion string must not exceed 56 characters.  The expansion
   string may contain any characters.  If the expansion string contains
   spaces and/or tabs, then it must be enclosed in quotes.


Control arguments:
-force, -fc
   specifies that the replacement of an existing symbol should be done
   without question.  If the symbol is already defined, and this
   argument is not specified, then the user is asked to authorize the
   replacement of the symbol.
-suffix STR
   enables or disables suffixing for this symbol.  STR must be either
   "on" or "off".  If STR is on, then suffixing is enabled and all
   suffixes are processed according to the default rules described in
   "Notes" below.  If STR is off, then all suffixes are disabled for
   the symbol.  (Default is on.)


-plural STR
   defines the plural suffix for this symbol.  STR must be "on" or
   "off", or a string that can be used as the plural of the expansion
   of this symbol.  If STR is on, then the plural suffix is enabled for
   this symbol and processed according to the default rules for the
   plural suffix.  If STR is off the plural suffix is disabled for this
   symbol.
-ed STR
   defines the ed suffix for this symbol.  This control argument
   follows the same rules as the -plural control argument.
-ing STR
   defines the ing suffix for this symbol.  This control argument
   follows the same rules as the -plural control argument.


-er STR
   defines the er suffix for this symbol.  This control argument
   follows the same rules as the -plural control argument.
-ly STR
   defines the ly suffix for this symbol.  This control argument
   follows the same rules as the -plural control argument.


Notes:  The default rule for appending a suffix string to an expansion
string is a function of the suffix and the word type of the expansion
string.


The word type of the expansion string is determined from its last
characters.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
