06/17/81  attach_audit, ata

Syntax:  ata {old_switch {new_switch}} {-control_args}


Function: starts auditing.  Moves the attachment of the specified
switch to another switch.  Attaches the first switch via audit_ to the
second.


Arguments: 
old_switch
   is the switch to be audited. (DEFAULT -- user_i/o)
new_switch
   is the dummy switch to receive old_switch's previous attachment. 
   (DEFAULT -- audit_i/o.time)


Control arguments: 
-pathname STR, -pn STR
   use STR as the audit file. (DEFAULT -- [homedir]>[date].audit)
-truncate, -tc
   truncate the audit file, if it already exists. 
   (DEFAULT -- extend it.)
-modes STR
   set the modes on user_i/o using STR as the mode string.


Notes: If no arguments or control arguments are given, auditing is set
up for user_i/o with a default audit file of [date].audit.  Multiple
uses on the same day are all logged, one after the other, in the same
audit file.  The attach_audit command sets the safety_switch "on" for
the audit file, detach_audit turns the safety_switch off.

For more information on the audit facility, type:
  help audit_
  help audit_.gi
  help detach_audit
  help audit_editor
  help display_audit_file
  help new_audit.gi

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
