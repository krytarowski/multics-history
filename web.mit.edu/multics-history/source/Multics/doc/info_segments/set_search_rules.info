03/07/84	set_search_rules, ssr

Syntax:  ssr {path} {-control_arg}


Function:	 sets, with only minor restrictions, your dynamic linking
search rules to suit your needs.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a segment containing the ASCII representation of
   search rules.  Search rules are absolute pathnames and any of the
   keywords listed below in "List of keywords", one search rule per
   line.	If path is not specified, the search rules must be reset to
   the default search rules by -default.


Control arguments:
-default, -df
   resets the search rules to the default search rules, as set for a
   new process.


List of keywords:
initiated_segments
   checks the already-initiated segments.
referencing_dir
   searches the containing directory of the segment making the
   reference.
working_dir
   searches the working directory.
home_dir
   searches the home directory.


process_dir
   searches the process directory.
site_defined
   expand into one or more directory pathnames.  (An example of a
   site_defined keyword is system_libraries.)  See the
   get_system_search_rules command for an explanation of the values of
   these keywords.	The "default" keyword can be used to obtain the
   site-defined default rules.


Notes:  A maximum of 21 rules is allowed.  Leading and trailing blanks
are allowed, but embedded blanks are not.

If you decide not to include the system libraries in the search
rules, many standard commands cannot be found.

See the add_search_rules, delete_search_rules, and print_search_rules,
info segments.  The standard search rules are described in Section 4
under "Search Rules" in the Programmer's Reference Manual (AG91).

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
