07/04/86  print_link_info, pli

Syntax as a command:  pli paths {-control_args}


Function:  prints selected items of information for the specified
object files.


Arguments:
paths
   are the pathnames of object files.  The archive component
   convention (::) is accepted.


Control arguments:
-entry, -et
   prints a listing of the pathi external definitions, giving their
   symbolic names and their relative addresses within the segment.
   If pathi is an object MSF, the external definitions in each of
   the executable components are listed.
-header, -he
   prints the header, which is not printed by default if -entry,
   -length, or -link is selected.
-length, -ln
   prints the lengths of the sections in pathi.  If pathi is an object
   MSF, the lengths of the sections for each executable component are
   printed.


-link, -lk
   prints an alphabetically sorted listing of all external symbols
   referenced by pathi.  If pathi is an object MSF, the list of
   external links in each executable component are listed.  Note that
   if a link is used  n more than one component, the link will be
   listed more than once.
-long
   prints additional information when the header is printed.  This
   information includes a listing of source programs used to generate
   the object file, the contents of the "comment" field of the
   symbol header (often containing compiler options), and any unusual
   values in the symbol header.
-no_header
   suppresses printing of the header.


Notes:  If no control arguments are chosen, -entry, -header, -length,
and -link are assumed.  If a path given is an object MSF, the information
for each of the executable components is printed.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
