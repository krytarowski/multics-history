Syntax:  delete_proj Project_id


Function:  is used by the dproj command in the master.ec segment.  It
does a portion of the work of deleting a project.  (Other commands
called by master.ec do the remainder.)


Arguments:
Project_id
   is the name of the project to be deleted.


Notes:  The entries for the specified project are marked as deleted in
the administrator's copy of the SAT (smf.cur.sat) and in the projfile
and reqfile segments.  Those entries are not physically removed
however.  In addition, the name "delete.Project_id.pdt" is added to the
Project_id.pdt segment in >sc1>pdt as a reminder that this PDT should
be deleted (by the system administrator) after the next monthly bills
are run.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
