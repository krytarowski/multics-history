12/14/80  dot_fig_index.compin

Syntax:  .ifi dot_fig_index "figure-title"


Function:
This compose macro adds a 'figure-title' to the list of Illustrations
in the Table of Contents, if creation of such a list has been enabled
(see fig_on.compin.info), without putting a centered Figure caption on
the output page.


Arguments:
'figure-title' is the title of the figure, as it is to appear in the
   list of Illustrations (first caps, no underlines).


Notes:
1) The dot_fig_index macro is used to generate a list of Illustrations
   entry when, for any reason, the dot_fig macro cannot be used to
   create the figure caption.
2) This macro advances the figure "dot number" counter so care must be
   taken in referencing the figure in the text.  The next use of the
   fig, fig_index, or fig_get_no macro resets the figure "dot number"
   counter back to zero.
3) See dot_fig.compin.info, fig.compin.info,
   dot_fig_get_no.compin.info, fig_get_no.compin.info, and
   fig_on.compin.info for related information.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
