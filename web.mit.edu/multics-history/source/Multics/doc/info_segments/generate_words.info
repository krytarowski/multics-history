Syntax:  gw {count} {-control args}


Function:  generates non-understandable words, which can be pronounced
phonetically.


Arguments:
count
   specifies number of words to be generated.  (Default is 1).


Control arguments:
-length N, -ln N
   specifies length of the words to be generated.  3<length<21.
-min N
   specifies minimum length of the words to be generated.
   3<min<max<21.  (Default is 6).
-max N
   specifies maximum length of the words to be generated.
   3<min<max<21.  (Default is 8).
-hyphenate, -hph
   displays the hyphenated version of the word.


-seed N
   allows the user to specify a value for the word generated.  The
   value must be a non-negative integer.  A value of zero indicates
   that a random seed is to be used.  Any other seed value results in

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
