Customer ordering information:  Automatic distribution of
documentation:  New sites are entitled to receive an "initial
allotment" of manuals free of charge.  The allotment of free manuals is
equivalent in value to five percent of the first month's rental fee, up
to a maximum of $1000.

In order to receive the initial allotment, the site sales
representative must submit a Honeywell Publications Requisition Form
(HIS 2808 (7/80)) to the Distribution Center.

If the system registration number is specified on the requisition form
(i.e., with the initial allotment request), the site will automatically
receive two copies of every update (future addendum or revision) for
the manuals requested.


In the event that the system registration number is not included on the
form, the site will receive only the initial allotment and no future
updates.

To receive manuals other than those in the site's initial allotment on
an automatic basis, contact the site sales representative and request
that a Honeywell Publications Requistion Form (HIS 2808 (7/80)) be
submitted with the site's system registration number so that the site
is registered to receive those manuals and all future updates to them.


General distribution of documentation:  To order specific manuals
(e.g., new manuals) in addition to those received with the initial
allotment, the customer must submit a Purchase Order through Honeywell
Customer Services (i.e., it is not necessary to submit the order
through the site sales representative).  The address of Honeywell
Customer Services is,

Publications Services (MA06/MS01)
Honeywell Information Systems Inc.
47 Harvard Street
Westwood, Massachusetts 02090

The telephone number is (617) 392-5235.


Honeywell Customer Publications Order Forms are included in the back of
the Honeywell Publications Catalog, Order Number AB81.  If a Customer
Publication Order Form is not available on site, a letter (on company
letterhead) will suffice.  If there are any questions, contact the
Customer Services organization described above.

 Notes:  A "hotline" service is available for emergency orders -- call
         (toll-free) 1-800 343-6665.

         Updates for manuals ordered through Customer Services must be
         reordered separately when the site becomes aware of new
         versions to the manuals:  updates are not sent automatically.


Employee ordering information:  Automatic distribution of
documentation:  Honeywell employees may be registered to receive
manuals (and updates to manuals) by product line, and/or category,
and/or type.  Employees must submit a Honeywell Publication Form (Form
Number AP13) to the Distribution Center.  The form must include the
department number to be charged and the appropriate approval signature.

New manuals, revisions, and addenda are sent on an automatic basis
after the registration becomes effective (i.e., the employee will not
automatically receive a base manual if the initial shipment contains
addenda).


General distribution of documentation:  To order specific manuals on an
"as needed" basis, submit the Honeywell Publications Requisition Form
(HIS 2808 (7/80)) to the Distribution Center.

 Notes:  A "hotline" service is available for emergency orders -- call
         (617) 392-5215.

         Updates to the manuals ordered "as needed" must also be
         ordered "as needed" (i.e., updates are not sent
         automatically).


Questions/comments/available manuals:  If there are any questions about
the distribution of manuals, contact the site sales representative, the
branch office servicing the site, or Honeywell Publications Services,
47 Harvard Street, Westwood MA 02090.

If you have any comments (e.g., find an error) or have suggestions for
improvement to a manual, please use the "Technical Publications Remarks
Form" (or a copy of same); this form is found at the back of every
publication.


Notes:  The online list of manuals on System M in Phoenix (type "help
manuals") contains a complete list of all current and forthcoming
(currently planned) manuals.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
