02/21/84  disk_stat_print

Syntax:  disk_stat_print {path} {-control_args}


Function:  prints the disk_stat segment that is created by the sweep
command.  Optional control arguments cause the information to be
presented in a variety of ways, to facilitate analysis of disk usage
patterns.  By default, a header is printed, followed by one line for
each directory in the disk_stat segment, and a totals line.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the disk_stat file to be printed.  If path is not
   given, the disk_stat segment in the working directory is assumed.


Control arguments:
-level N, -lev N
   summarizes each subtree that begins at level N; prints no lines with
   level numbers greater than N (where N is an integer from 0 to 16).
   The effect of this argument is to make the output appear as if no
   directories with quotas existed below level N in the hierarchy since
   the directories below level N have their usage figures included in
   those of whatever level N directory they are inferior to.


   The default value for N is 16, causing all directories in disk_stat
   to be printed individually.  The root's level is 0.  A directory is
   said to be below level N if its level number is greater than N.  A
   value of 2 for N causes the disk usage of each project to be
   displayed in a single line; a value of 3 causes the usage of each
   user to be displayed (provided that the user directories have
   quotas).


-logical_volume, -lv
   prints the name of the logical volume on which segments contained in
   each directory reside and prints the usage figures for each logical
   volume.  An extra column is printed in the directory line, giving
   the logical volume index (lvix).  This is merely the line number in
   the table of logical volume totals that is printed after the regular
   totals lines.  An lvix of 0 indicates that the subtree summarized by
   the line contains segments that reside on more than one logical
   volume; an lvix of -1 indicates a logical volume not known to the
   system.


-subtotal, -stt
   prints subtotal lines giving the totals for each subtree.  Each time
   a directory is encountered whose level number is less than that of
   the preceding directory, one or more subtotal lines are printed.
   This argument causes the maximum amount of subtotal information to
   be printed.  Some users may find the resulting output too cluttered
   to be easily read.  To produce less information, but in an easier to
   read format, see the -level control argument.
-total, -tt
   does not print a line for each directory; rather prints a totals
   line (plus any other lines specified by other arguments).


Notes:  The first date printed in the header is the date of the last
billing.  It is filled in by charge_disk if the disk_stat file is the
one used by the daily disk accounting job.  This date is 0 in files
created separately (e.g., for use in disk usage analysis).

Although the output of disk_stat_print is designed to be printed on a
line printer (using the file_output and dprint commands), it can be
printed on a terminal if the carriage is wide enough.  Each line
consists of approximately 10 characters followed by a pathname.
Pathnames can be up to 168 characters long but are typically less
than 50 characters long.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
