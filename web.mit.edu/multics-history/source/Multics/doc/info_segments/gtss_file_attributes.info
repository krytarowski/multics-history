03/07/80 Attributes for GCOS TSS files

The GCOS TSS Environment Simulator requires that pre-existing files have
their attributes set and available for use. Thus, files
created by gcos_card_utility, gcos_fms, or the GCOS Batch Environment
Simulator must have their attributes added before they can be used.

An exec_com is provided for this purpose; the user invokes the exec_com
with the pathname of the file to be processed. The exec_com then queries the
user interactively for the required information.

To use the exec_com, type "ec >unb>gtss_file_attributes path" or
"ec >unb>attr path", where path is the pathname of the file to have
its attributes added or altered.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
