01/28/86  delete_message, dlm

Syntax as a command:  dlm msg_specs {mbx_specification} {-control_args}


Function: deletes any interprocess messages that were received (and
saved in the user's mailbox) while the user was not accepting messages,
not logged in, or accept_messages -hold_messages was in effect.


Arguments:
msg_specs
   are one or more numbers or ranges.  Numbers are as printed next to
   each message when accept_messages -hold_messages is in effect.
   Ranges are of the form N:M, where N<=M and both N and M are valid
   message numbers.  You can use the keywords "first" (f) and "last"
   (l) as message numbers and the keyword "all" (a) as a range
   (equivalent to "f:l").
mbx_specification
   specifies the mailbox on which messages are to be deleted.  If not
   given, the user's default mailbox (>udd>Project>Person>Person.mbx)
   is used.


List of mbx specifications:
-log
   specifies the user's logbox and is equivalent to
      -mailbox >udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.sv.mbx
-mailbox path, -mbx path
   specifies the pathname of a mailbox.  The suffix .mbx is added if
   necessary.
-save path, -sv path
   specifies the pathname of a savebox.  The suffix .sv.mbx is added if
   necessary.


-user STR
   specifies either a user's default mailbox or an entry in the system
   mail table.
STR
   is any noncontrol argument and is first interpreted as -mailbox STR;
   if no mailbox is found, STR is then interpreted as -save STR; if no
   savebox is found, it is interpreted as -user STR.


Control arguments:
-after time_string
   deletes messages sent after time_string only (see "Notes").
-all, -a
   delets all messages, including those held by -hold_messages mode
   (see accept_messages).
-before time_string
   deletes messages sent before time_string only (see "Notes").
-brief, -bf
   suppresses an error message when no matching messages are found.
-comment STR, -com STR
   deletes messages with comment fields containing STR only.
-exclude STR
   deletes messages with text not containing STR only.


-force, -fc
   deletes selected unseen messages.
-from STR, -fm STR
   deletes messages sent from STR only.  STR can be of the form
   Person.Project, Person, or .Project.
-long, -lg
   overrides -brief.
-match STR
   deletes messages with text containing STR only.
-messages, -msg
   deletes regular messages (nonnotifications) only.
-no_force, -nfc
   prevents deletion of unseen messages.  (Default)


-no_messages, -nmsg
   suppresses -messages.
-no_notifications, -nnt
   suppresses -notifications.
-notifications, -nt
   deletes notifications only.


Notes: If you supply no mailbox, your default one is assumed (for a
description of the mailbox see accept_messages and print_mail).

See time_strings.gi for a description of valid time_string values.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
