02/21/84  disklow

Syntax:  disklow {left {pct}


Function: allows the system administrator to scan the projfile segment
and report on each project whose remaining disk storage (difference
between quota and used) is low.  The disk storage can be checked
either by number of free records or percent of disk occupied or both.


Arguments:
left
   prints a line for all projects with less than left free records,
   where left is in integer.
pct
   prints a line for all projects occupying more than pct percent of
   their disk storage quota.


Notes:  Left must be given in order to give pct.  The default values
for left and pct are 20 and 90, respectively.  If the system
administrator wants to receive only percentage information, he must
given left as 0.

The projfile segment is assumed to be in the working directory and is
an implicit input to disklow.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
