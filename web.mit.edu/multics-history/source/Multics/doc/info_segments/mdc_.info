02/08/84  mdc_

The mdc_ subroutine (actually a ring 1 gate) provides a series of entry
points for manipulation of master directories.


Entry points in mdc_:
   (List is generated by the help command)


:Entry:  create_dir:  02/08/84 mdc_$create_dir


Function:  This entry point is used to create a new master directory.
Its arguments are roughly analogous to the hcs_$append_branchx entry
point.


Syntax:
declare mdc_$create_dir entry (char(*), char(*), char(*), fixed bin(5),
     (3) fixed bin(3), char(*), fixed bin, fixed bin(35));
call mdc_$create_dir (dir_name, entryname, volume, mode, rings,
     user_id, quota, code);


Arguments:
dir_name
   is the pathname of the containing directory.  (Input)
entryname
   is the entryname of the subdirectory.  (Input)
volume
   is the name of the logical volume that is to contain segments
   created in the new directory.  (Input)
mode
   is the user's access mode.  (Input)
rings
   are the ring brackets of the directory.  (Input) Only the first
   values are used.


user_id
   is an access control name.  (Input)
quota
   is the quota to be placed on the new directory.  (Input)
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output)


:Entry:  create_dirx:  02/08/84 mdc_$create_dirx


Function:  This entry point is an extension of the mdc_$create_dir
entry point, which is similiar to hcs_$create_branch_ entry point.


Syntax:
declare mdc_$create_dirx entry (char(*), char(*), char(*), ptr,
     fixed bin(35));
call mdc_$create_dirx (dir_name, entryname, volume, info_ptr, code);


Arguments:
dir_name
   is the pathname of the containing directory.  (Input)
entryname
   is the entryname of the subdirectory.  (Input)
volume
   is the name of the logical volume that is to contain segments
   created in the new directory.  (Input)

call mdc_$delete_dir (dir_name, entryname, code);


Arguments:
dir_name
   is the pathname of the containing directory.  (Input)

:Entry:  pvname_info:  02/08/84 mdc_$pvname_info


Function:  This entry point gets various kinds of information about a
specified storage-system physical volume.


Syntax:
declare mdc_$pvname_info entry (char (*), bit (36) aligned, char (*),
     bit (36) aligned, fixed bin, fixed bin (35));
call mdc_$pvname_info (pvname, pvid, lvname, lvid, device_type, code);


Arguments:
pvname
   is the name of the physical volume about which information is to be
   returned.  (Input)
pvid
   is the physical volume id of the specified volume.  It can be used
   as a parameter to ring-zero volume and partition interfaces.
   (Output)
lvname
   is the name of the logical volume to which the physical volume
   belongs.  (Output)
lvid
   is the logical volume id of the logical volume to which the physical
   volume belongs.  (Output)


device_type
   is a number indicating what type of device the specified physical
   volume is mounted on.  The names and characteristics of these
   devices are listed in various arrays declared in the include file
   fs_dev_types.incl.pl1.  (Output)
code
   is a standard system-status code.  It is nonzero if the information
   about the volume cannot be obtained or if the volume does not exist.
   (Output)


:Entry:  set_mdir_account:  02/08/84 mdc_$set_mdir_account


Function:  This entry point is used to set the quota account of a
master directory.


Syntax:
declare mdc_$set_mdir_account entry (char(*), char(*), char(*),
     fixed bin(35));
call mdc_$set_mdir_account (dir_name, entryname, account, code);


Arguments:
dir_name
   is the pathname of the containing directory.  (Input)
entryname
   is the entryname of the subdirectory.  (Input)
account
   is the name of the new quota account.  The directory quota is
   returned to the old account and redrawn from this new account.
code
   is a standard system status code.  (Output)


:Entry:  set_mdir_owner:  02/08/84 mdc_$set_mdir_owner


Function:  This entry point is used to set the owner name of a master
directory.


Syntax:
declare mdc_$set_mdir_owner entry (char(*), char(*), char(*),
     fixed bin(35));
call mdc_$set_mdir_owner (dir_name, entryname, owner, code);


Arguments:
dir_name
   is the pathname of the containing directory.  (Input)
entryname
   is the entryname of the subdirectory.  (Input)
owner
   is the new owner name of the master directory, in the form
   Person_id.Project_id.tag.  (Input)
code
   is a standard system status code.  (Output)


:Entry:  set_mdir_quota:  02/08/84 mdc_$set_mdir_quota


Function:  This entry point is used to set the quota on a master
directory.


Syntax:
declare mdc_$set_mdir_quota entry (char(*), char(*), bit(1) aligned,
     fixed bin, fixed bin(35));
call mdc_$set_mdir_quota (dir_name, entryname, sw, quota, code);


Arguments:
dir_name
   is the pathname of the containing directory.  (Input)
entryname
   is the entryname of the subdirectory.  (Input)
sw
   is a switch indicating the kind of quota change.  (Input)
   "0"b sets the directory quota to the quota parameter.
   "1"b algebraically adds the quota parameter to the current directory
        quota.
quota
   is the quota to be placed on the new directory.  (Input)
code
   is a standard system status code.  (Output)


:Entry:  set_volume_quota:  02/08/84 mdc_$set_volume_quota


Function:  This entry point is used to set the volume quota for a quota
account on a logical volume.


Syntax:
declare mdc_$set_volume_quota entry (char(*), char(*), bit(1) aligned,
     fixed bin, fixed bin(35));
call mdc_$set_volume_quota (volume, account, sw, quota, code);


Arguments:
volume
   is the name of the logical volume that is to contain segments
   created in the new directory.  (Input)
account
   is the name of the quota account in the form
   Person_id.Project_id.tag.  The quota account name may contain stars.
   (Input)
sw
   is a switch indicating the kind of quota change.  (Input)

   "1"b algebraically adds the quota parameter to the current directory
        quota.


quota
   is the quota to be placed on the new directory.  (Input)
code
   is a standard system status code.  (Output)

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
