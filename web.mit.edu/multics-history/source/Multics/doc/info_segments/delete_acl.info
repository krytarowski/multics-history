02/11/85  delete_acl, da

Syntax as a command:  da path {User_ids} {-control_args}


Function: removes entries from the access control lists (ACLs) of
nonlink entries in a directory (see ACL.gi).


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of an entry.  If it is -working_directory (-wd),
   your working directory is assumed.  The star convention is allowed.
User_ids
   are access control names of the form Person_id.Project_id.tag.  All
   ACL entries with matching names are deleted.  If you give no
   User_ids, your Person_id and current Project_id are assumed.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   deletes all ACL entries except for *.SysDaemon.*.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the messages "User name not on ACL" and "Empty ACL."
-chase
   chases links when using the star convention.  Links are always
   chased when path is not a star name.
-directory, -dr
   affects only directories.  (Default: segments, multisegment files,
   and directories)
-no_chase
   does not chase links when using the star convention.  (Default)


-segment, -sm
   affects only segments and multisegment files.
-select_entry_type STR, -slet STR
   affects only entries of the entry type selected by STR, which is a
   comma-delimited list of file system entry types.  Use the
   list_entry_types command to obtain a list of valid entry type
   values.  Example: da ** -slet mbx,segment.


Access required: You need modify permission on the containing
directory.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
