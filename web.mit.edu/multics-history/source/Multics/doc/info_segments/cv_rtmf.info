01/24/84  cv_rtmf

Syntax:  cv_rtmf rtmf_path {-control_args}


Function:  converts an ASCII resource type master file (RTMF) into a
binary resource type description table (RTDT).  The binary table is
installed using the install command (see the MAM System).  If the user
has made any errors in the RTMF, this command prints error messages
while performing the conversion.


Arguments:
rtmf_path
   is the pathname of the resource type master file.  If path does not
   have a suffix of rtmf, one is assumed.  However, the suffix rtmf
   must be the last component of the name of the source segment.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   prints short form of error messages
-long, -lg
   prints long form of error messages
-severity N, -sv N
   causes error messages whose severity is less than N (where N is 0,
   1, 2, 3, or 4) not to be written to the user_output switch.  If this
   control argument is not specified, a severity level of 0 is assumed
   (i.e., all error messages are written to the user_output switch).


Notes:  If no control arguments are given, an error message is printed
in long form the first time it occurs, and in short form thereafter.

The converted resource type master file is given a name corresponding
to the entryname of the source segment, with the rtmf suffix replaced
by rtdt.  It is placed in the working directory.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
