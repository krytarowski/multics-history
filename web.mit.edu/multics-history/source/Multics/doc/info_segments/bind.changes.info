11/19/84 bind.changes

The binder has been changed to allow an unlimited number of object
components to be bound.  (The bound segment may not, however, exceed
one segment.)

The old limit of 30 has been removed from the number of input and
updated archives.

Standalone segments are now accepted by using the new -segment control
argument.  Also see the new -archive control argument.

The -bindfile control argument has been added which allows the user to
override the bindfile seletion method.

Zero-length objects will no longer result in fatal errors.  A warning
is issued and the object is ignored.

The bindfile parsing routine has been rewritten using the reduction
compiler.  As a result, the error messages look slightly
different than before, e.g.,

		ERROR 22 SEVERITY 3 in LINE 20
		Objectname foo not mentioned in order statement

2 new bindfile master keywords have been added: Partial_Order and
Ignore.

For more information on the above see the binder help file (bind.info).

Error numbers 16, 22, and 23 in the binder error list have been fixed.
Note that error 16 caused adding the names of all the components to
the bound segment if the "Addname:;" statement were included in the
bindfile.  The code now conforms to the documentation and only the
names of those components that have external symbols retained will be
added.

When adding names, the binder now uses nd_handler_ to resolve name
duplications.  This may cause names to be removed from other entries
in the same directory.  Before removing the last name from another
segment, the user is queried if that entry is to be deleted.

Error 17 has been partially fixed.  If "syntax" errors are found in
the bindfile, the existing bound segment will not be truncated.
"Semantic" errors, e.g.
	...
	objectname: foo;
	retain: bar;
	...
where entrypoint "bar" does not exist in "foo", are detected upon
examining the individual object components when rebuilding of the
bound segment has already started.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
