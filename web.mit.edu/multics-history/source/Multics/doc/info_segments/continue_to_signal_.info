:Entry: continue_to_signal_: 02/06/84  continue_to_signal_


Function: enables an on unit that cannot completely handle a condition
to tell the signalling program, upon its return, to search the stack
for other on units for the condition.  The search continues with the
stack frame immediately preceding the frame for the block containing
the on unit.  However, if a separate on unit for the any_other
condition is established in the same block activation as the caller of
continue_to_signal_, that on unit is invoked before the stack is
searched further.


Syntax:
declare continue_to_signal_ entry (fixed bin(35));
call continue_to_signal_ (code);


Arguments:
code
   is a standard status code and is nonzero if continue_to_signal_ was
   called when no condition was signalled.  (Output)

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
