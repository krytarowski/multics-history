10 March 82: trace_mcs

Function:  Controls the MCS tracing facility and prints MCS trace table
entries.


Syntax:  trace_mcs print {channel_name(s)} {-control_arguments}
         trace_mcs reset
         trace_mcs modes {new_modes} {-control_arguments}
         trace_mcs channel {channel_name(s)} {-control_arguments}
         trace_mcs table_size {new_table_size} {-control_arguments}


List of keywords:
print, pr, p
   Prints entries from the trace table.
reset, rs
   Resets MCS tracing: sets global modes to off,^default,none, sets the
   trace table size to zero, and turns off both channel tracing flags
   for all channels. No additional arguments are allowed.
modes
   Prints the current global tracing modes, or changes the specified
   modes if a new_modes argument is present. See "List of modes", below.


channel, chn
   Prints or changes the tracing flags for a single channel or group of
   channels. At least one of printing or changing must be specified, and
   at least one channel_name must be specified. 
table_size, ts
   Changes the size of the MCS trace table. The table size may only be
   changed when tracing is disabled, and if a trace table exists, the
   size must be first changed to zero and then to the new value in order
   to change the size to a different nonzero value. If no new table size
   is supplied, the current table size is printed.


Arguments:
channel_name(s)
   Up to 20 different channel names may be specified. The channel names
   may be starnames, and all channels which match any of the supplied
   names is selected for the operation.
new_modes
   Is the new mode string containing the global MCS tracing modes to be
   changed. See "List of modes", below.
table_size
   Is a decimal integer specifying the number of entries in the MCS
   trace table. Each entry occupies 16 words in tty_buf. The program
   queries if the new trace table size will occupy more than 50 percent
   of the free space in tty_buf, to guard against errors.


Control arguments (all functions):
-erf NNN
   Takes the MCS trace table from the FDUMP for ERF NNN. If this
   argument is specified, no parameters (modes, channel flags, table
   size) may be changed, although they can be printed.


Control arguments (print):
-reset, -rs
   Resets the last trace entry indicator in trace_mcs. Normally, only
   those entries which have been added to the trace table since the last
   time entries were printed are printed. If -reset is specified, the
   next use of trace_mcs will print all the trace table entries.
-all, -a
   Prints all trace table entries, but without resetting or changing the
   last entry indicator.
-last NNN, -lt NNN
   Prints the last NNN entries in the trace table, without resetting or
   changing the last entry indicator.
-reverse, -rev
   Prints the entries in reverse order. This can only be specified if -all
   or -last is also specified.
{-channel} XXX, {-chn} XXX
   Selects a channel or group of channels for printing. This control
   argument need not be supplied before the channel name, and is
   provided only for compatibility.


Control argumentds (channel):
-print, -pr
   Causes the state of the channel trace flags for the selected channels
   to be printed. If -on or -off is also specified, both the previous
   and new states are printed.
-on
   Turns on the "trace" flag for the channel(s). If this flag is
   different from the "default" global mode, and the force flag is not
   also set, the channel is traced. If the force flag is set, the
   channel is traced regardless of the state of the "default" mode.
-off
   Turns off the "trace" flag for the channel(s). Only one of -on and
   -off may be specified.
-force, -fc
   Sets the "force" flag for the channel. If the force flag is set, the
   channel is traced or not depending only on the state of its "trace"
   flag, and not on the "default" mode. If -force is specified, one of
   -on or -off must also be specified.


Control arguments (modes):
-brief, -bf
   Suppresses the printing of the new mdes after the change is applied.
   Normally, the modes now in effect are printed.
-long, -lg
   Prints the new mode string after the changes are applied (Default).


List of modes:
on
   Whether tracing is enabled at all. The "on" mode may also be
   represented as "^off", and "^on" as "off".
default
   Whether channels are traced by default. Normally, this is off,
   meaning that only channels whose trace flag is set are traced.
all
   May only be specified as "all", not "^all". This mode is a shorthand
   for setting all the remaining modes (except "none"), used to turn on
   tracing for all MCS events.
none
   May only be specified as "none", and not as "^none". This mode is
   shorthand for resetting all the remaining modes. It is usually used
   in combination with some other mode or modes, to trace only those
   specific operations.


read
   Whether channel_manager$read operations are traced.
write
   Whether channel_manager$write operations are traced.
data
   Whether the data in read and write operations is to be recorded in
   the trace table, as well as the events themselves.
control
   Whether channel_manager$control operations are traced.
modes
   Whether channel_manager$check_modes, get_modes, and set_modes
   operations are traced.


interrupt
   Whether channel_manager$interrupt, interrupt_later, and
   queued_interrupt operations are to be traced.
init_mpx
   Whether to trace priv_channel_manager$init_multiplexer operations.
start_mpx
   Whether to trace priv_channel_manager$start_multiplexer operations.
stop_mpx
   Whether to trace priv_channel_manager$stop_multiplexer operations.
space_man
   Whether to trace calls to tty_space_man requesting non-buffer type
   space. (Apparently not implemented)


Access required:
Access to phcs_ is required to print the trace table of the running
system. Access to the FDUMP is required to access the trace table in an
FDUMP. Access to hphcs_ is required to change any parameters for the
running system.


Notes:
The MCS trace table is kept in a circular array, with old entries being
overwritten by new ones. Each entry contains the time, the device index
of the associated channel, and a short string identifying the operation.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
