10/17/84   General Information 

The Multics help system includes a number of info segments (info segs)
that contain general information (gi) about features or use of the
system.  The info names of these segments end with the suffix
"gi.info".  For example, acl_matching.gi.info describes how Access
Control List (acl) entries are matched with User_ids in access control
commands such as set_acl.  The suffix ".info" is assumed if you don't
provide it; so to get the info segment on acl_matching, type,
   help acl_matching.gi

To get a complete list of the info segs whose names have the suffix
"gi.info", use the list_help command:
   list_help gi

If you want a list of info segs that pertain to a particular subject,
type a word, or a string of characters that is part of a word, that
describes that subject and list_help prints a list of all info names
containing that word or partial word.  For example, if you want a list
of info segs that describe the Multics mail facility, type,
   list_help mail

For more information about list_help, including its method for
matching character strings, type,
   help list_help

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
