01/31/84  display_cdt

Syntax:  display_cdt {channel} {-control_args}


Function:  enables a qualified user to display the contents of a
channel definition table (CDT).


Arguments:
channel
   is the name of the communications channel for which the CDT entry is
   to be displayed.  The star convention is allowed.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   displays names and CDT indices for all channels in the CDT.
-brief, -bf
   displays only channel names and CDT indices (without channel or FNP
   details).  This is the default for the -all and -subtree control
   arguments.
-cmf path
   creates a CMF in the segment named path in a form suitable to
   cv_cmf, based on the contents of the CDT.
-header, -he
   displays the CDT header variables in addition to other requested
   information.


-long, -lg
   displays detailed information for the specified channel or FNP.
   This is the default unless -all or -subtree is specified, in which
   case -brief is the default.
-no_header, -nhe
   suppresses display of the CDT header variables.  This is the
   default.
-pathname path, -pn path
   displays the CDT whose pathname is path.  By default, the CDT in the
   segment >sc1>cdt is displayed.
-subtree
   displays the names and CDT indices for all subchannels (if any) of
   the specified channel.


Notes:  If display_cdt is specified with no channel name and no control
arguments, a usage error notification is returned.  Specifying channel
name only, with no control arguments, results in a -long display.

The display_cdt command enables the user to check for inconsistencies
in a CDT before unnecessarily undertaking corrective action.

The user must have r access to the CDT to invoke the display_cdt
command.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
