07/30/86  Relative pathnames (general information)

Relative pathnames are pathnames which are interpreted relative to the
working directory.  An entryname or a pathname which does not begin
with a greater than character (">") is a relative pathname.  A relative
pathname may begin with one or more less than characters ("<").  Each
less than character is interpreted as one directory level closer to the
root directory than the working directory.  A relative pathname may
be converted to an absolute pathname if the working directory is known,
provided that there are no more less than characters in the relative
pathname than there are directory names in the working directory
pathname.


Notes: For more information on pathnames, see pathname.gi.info.


Examples:
Assume that the working directory is >udd>Demo>JQUser.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
