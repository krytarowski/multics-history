02/08/85  date_time

Syntax as a command:  date_time {time_string} {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:
   [date_time {time_string} {DT} {-control_args}]


Function: returns a date and time value for a specified date-time or
the current date-time consisting of a date, a time from 0000.0 to
2359.9, a time zone, and a day of the week.  The date and time value is
returned as a single quoted string of the form
"mm/dd/yy  hhmm.m zzz www" (e.g., "06/01/84  0840.9 mst Fri").  The
format string to produce this is
"^my/^dm/^yc  ^Hd^99v.9MH ^xxxxza^xxxda".


Arguments:
time_string
   indicates the date_time about which information is desired.  If you
   supply no time_string, the current date and time are used.  The time
   string is concatenated to form a single argument even if it contains
   spaces; you need not quote it.  (See time_strings.gi for a
   description of valid time_string values.)


Control arguments:
-language STR, -lang STR
   STR specifies the language in which month name, day names, and zone
   names are to be expressed.  (Default: the process default)
-zone STR
   STR specifies the zone that is to be used to express the result.
   (Default: the process default)


Notes: Use the print_time_defaults command to display the default
language and zone.  Use the display_time_info command to display a list
of all acceptable language and zone values.

Due to exec_coms, etc., that have been built around the expected
date_time format, this command does not honor the process date_time
format (set by set_time_default).  You are encouraged to use "clock
date_time" in place of date_time to get the proper default handling.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
