07/16/79  transaction_call_

Function: This subroutine performs operations on a vfile_ transaction control
file (TCF) I/O switch.


Entry points in transaction_call_:


:Entry:assign:  07/16/79  transaction_call_$assign

Syntax:
call transaction_call_$assign (tcf_iocb_ptr, transaction_no, code);
dcl transaction_call_$assign entry (ptr, fixed bin(35), fixed bin(35));


:Entry:commit:  07/16/79  transaction_call_$commit

Syntax:
call transaction_call_$commit (tcf_iocb_ptr, transaction_no, code);
dcl transaction_call_$commit entry (ptr, fixed bin(35), fixed bin(35));


:Entry:number:  07/16/79  transaction_call_$number

Syntax:
call transaction_call_$number (tcf_iocb_ptr, transaction_no, code);
dcl transaction_call_$number entry (ptr, fixed bin(35), fixed bin(35));


:Entry:rollback:  07/16/79  transaction_call_$rollback

Syntax:
call transaction_call_$rollback (tcf_iocb_ptr, transaction_no, code);
dcl transaction_call_$rollback entry (ptr, fixed bin(35), fixed bin(35));


:Entry:status:  07/16/79  transaction_call_$status

Syntax:
call transaction_call_$status (tcf_iocb_ptr, transaction_no, trc_flags,
   trc_status_ptr, transaction_status, code);
dcl transaction_call_$status entry (ptr, fixed bin(35), bit(36) aligned, ptr,
   fixed bin, fixed bin(35));


Notes: Structure for trc_flags, trc_status and named constants for
transaction_status are in transaction_call.incl.pl1.


:Entry:transact:  07/16/79  transaction_call_$transact

Syntax:

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
