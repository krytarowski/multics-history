01/27/84  deregister_resource, drr

Syntax:  drr type STR1 ...  STRN


Function:  makes a particular resource unknown to the system.  The
deregistration process informs the system that the resource is no
longer available for use.


Arguments:
type
   is a resource type defined in the RTDT.
STRi
   is the unique identifying name of the particular resource being
   deregistered.  If STR looks like a control argument (i.e., if it is
   preceded by a hyphen), then it must be preceded by -name or -nm.


Notes:  To be deregistered, the resource must be in the free state.  A
resource owned by a user (or belonging to the system pool) must be
released (see release_resource.info) before it may be deregistered.

If multiple resource names are specified to the deregister_resource
command and an error occurs in the deregistration of any of these
resources, none of the resources are deregistered.


Access required:
     The use of this command requires execute access to the rcp_admin_
gate.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
