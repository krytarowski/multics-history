08/06/84  display_mrds_db_population, dmdbp

Syntax as a command:  dmdbp path {-control_args}


Function:  This command displays the current tuple count for each
relation in the given data base model or submodel view.  It can also
display population statistics about the vfile for each relation's data.


Arguments:
path
   is the relative or absolute pathname of the data base model or
   submodel, with or without suffix, that is to have the relation's
   population statistics displayed.  If both a data model and submodel
   of the same name are in the same directory, then the model will be
   found if no suffix is given.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   limits the output display to only relation names and their current
   tuple count.  (Default)
-long, -lb
   displays the average number of tuples selected by index during
   retrieval.
-relation rel_name1 ...  rel_nameN
   specifies that only the population for those relations whose names
   are given in the rel_nameI list are to be displayed according to the
   other control arguments.  This control_arg must appear after path.


Notes:  Version 3 data bases must have been opened at least once for
exclusive update.  They cannot have secondary index information
displayed.

For version 4 data bases, only a DBA may use this command on a secured
data base, with the model view.  The user must have at least "r" access
to the relation model segment and the relation data vfile for those
relations in the view presented by "path".


Examples:

   display_mrds_db_population test -bf

   Opening version 4 data model:  >udd>m>jg>dr>test.db

       RELATION                            TUPLES

         r001                                100
         r002                                100

   display_mrds_db_population x001 -long


   Displaying version 4 data model: >udd>d>dbmt>ndb>K>x>doc>x001.db

   RELATION  TUPLES    INDEX     AVE TUPLES SELECTED

   r001      100
                       x001      16

A description of the -long form output follows:

   Relation:  the name of the relation in the user's view.

   Tuples:  the number of tuples currently stored as records in the
   vfile.

   Index:  the indexed attributes in the relation.

   Ave Tuples Selected:  the number of tuples that MRDS expects to
   retrieve when doing a comparison on an indexed attribute.  This
   estimate is based on the number of duplicate keys for that index.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
