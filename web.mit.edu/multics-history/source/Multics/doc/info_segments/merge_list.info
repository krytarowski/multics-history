10/20/86  merge_list, mls


Syntax as a command:  mls mas_path up_path {out_path} {-control_args}


Function:  combines two lister files into a single lister file.


Arguments:
mas_path
   is the pathname of the master lister file.  The suffix lister must
   be the last component of the lister file name; however, if mas_path
   does not have a suffix of lister, one is assumed.
up_path
   is the pathname of the update lister file.  The suffix lister must
   be the last component of the lister file name; however, if up_path
   does not have a suffix of lister, one is assumed.
out_path
   is the pathname of the output lister file.  The suffix lister must
   be the last component of the lister file name; however, if out_path
   does not have a suffix of lister, one is assumed.  If this argument
   is not specified, the master lister file is replaced.


Control arguments:
-field_name fn1 ...  fni, -fn fn1 ...  fni
   specifies that fields fn1 through fni are used as the controlling
   fields for the merge.  (Records can only be merged if they contain
   the same fields, though some of those fields may be null.)  The
   fields are compared without regard to case.  If this control
   argument is not specified, then all fields are used to control the
   merge.
-totals, -tt
   displays the number of records in the master, update, and output
   files.


Only one of the following control arguments can be specified.
-add
   copies into the output lister file all records from the master
   lister file plus all records from the update lister file.  Thus
   records contained in both lister files are listed twice in the
   output file.  (Default)
-and
   copies into the output file those records in the master lister file
   that are also in the update lister file.  That is, those records
   that are listed in both files are listed once in the output file; no
   records from the update lister file are copied.


-or
   copies into the output lister file all records in either the master
   lister file or the update lister file.  Duplicate records are copied
   only from the update lister file and thus appear only once in the
   output file.
-subtract, -sub
   copies into the output lister file all records in the master lister
   file that are not also contained in the update lister file.  Thus no
   duplicate records are copied and no records from the update lister
   file are copied.


Notes:  The merge_list command sets the "lister" severity indicator.  A
severity of 2 is set when the merge is not performed or the invocation
of merge_list terminates abnormally.  A severity of 0 is set when the
merge is successful and the command terminates normally.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
