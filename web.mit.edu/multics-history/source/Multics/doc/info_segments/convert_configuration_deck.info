Syntax:  convert_configuration_deck ascii_path binary_path


Function: converts an ascii source form of a configuration deck, as 
produced by print_configuration_deck, into a binary (system) form.


Arguments:
ascii_path
   is the pathname of an ascii source form of a config deck.  Both labeled 
   and unlabeled fields may appear on the config cards.  The 
   archive convention is allowed.
binary_path
   is the pathname of the resultant binary config deck.  The form is 
   compatible with the system config deck.  The equals convention is 
   recognized.


Notes: This command is intended to be used to perform a level of 
validation on a proposed new ascii config deck.  It may also be used 
to convert an ascii config deck into the form required by 
compare_configuration_deck.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
