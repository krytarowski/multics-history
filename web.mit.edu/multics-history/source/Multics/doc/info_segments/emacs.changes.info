02/17/89  Significant changes in Emacs 12.9 for MR12.3

1.  f (rmail-forward) to forward the current message to an address
    (list) that will be prompted for.  A numeric argument will allow
    the user to enter redistribution comments via a comments buffer.

2.  x (rmail-toggle-seen) to toggle the seen switch on the current
    message.  This switch is displayed to the user as the minor mode
    "Seen" and will be turned on immediately a message is brought into
    the RMAIL buffer to be displayed.

3.  ?  (rmail-help) to display brief information about each of the
    RMAIL mode (additionally the reply and comment buffers) requests
    that are available.

4.  q (rmail-quit) is being modified to only question a user quitting
    when no rmail commands have been entered between the arrival of
    new mail and requesting of rmail-quit.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
