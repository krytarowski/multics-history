Syntax:  .ifi argument "argument" ...
      OR .ifi arg	   "argument" ...


Function:
This macro formats arguments as members of a list of arguments (see
argument_list.compin.info concerning intializing the argument list).


Macro action:
1) inserts argument separation white space as appropriate for the de-
   vice
2) formats one or more "argument"s in 10pt Helvetica Roman (also see
   Notes) undented (hanging) by one indentation level, each on a line
   by itself


NOTES:
1) A call to this macro should be followed by text describing the argu-
   ment.
2) If "argument" contains white space, it must be given as a quoted
   string.
3) "argument" may contain both literal fields and variable fields.
   These fields are distinguished in the output by presenting the vari-
   able fields in 10pt Helvetica Bold Italc instead of Roman.  Variable
   fields are denoted by enclosing them between tilde (~) characters.
   For example

      file~XX~

   (as might appear for some command written in FORTRAN) will present
   "file" in Roman and "XX" in Bold Italic.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
