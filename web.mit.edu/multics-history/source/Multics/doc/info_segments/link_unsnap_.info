:Entry: link_unsnap_: 02/07/84  link_unsnap_

Function: restores snapped links pointing to a given segment or its
linkage section.  Such links then appear as if they had never been
snapped (changed into ITS pairs).  This is accomplished by
sequentially indexing through the Linkage Offset Table (LOT) and for
each linkage section listed there by searching for links to be
restored.


Syntax:
declare link_unsnap_ entry (ptr, ptr, ptr, fixed bin(17),
     fixed bin(17));
call link_unsnap_ (lot_ptr, isot_ptr, linkage_ptr, hcsc, high_seg);


Arguments:
lot_ptr
   is a pointer to the LOT.  (Input)
isot_ptr
   is a printer to the ISOT.  (Input)
linkage_ptr
   is a pointer to the linkage section to be discarded.  (Input)
hscs
   is one less than the segment number of the first segment that can be
   unsnapped.  (Input)
high_seg
   is the number of LOT slots used in searching for links to be
   restored.  (Input)

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
