08/02/84  gcos_library_summary, gcls

Syntax as a command:  gcls path {-control_args}


Function:  This command prints a summary of the contents of a GCOS
tape-format system-loadable file or a simulator-format software
library.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of either a GCOS format system-loadable file or a
   simulator-format software library file.


Control arguments:
brief, -bf
   prints only the names of the modules, omitting any preface or
   catalog information.
-gcos, -gc
   identifies the input file as a GCOS ** file.
-preface
   prints the preface record information found at the beginning of each
   module.


Notes:  If path is a GCOS format file as copied from a Total System
Tape, then gcls lists the modules and the preface information.

If path is a GCOS simulator-format library, then gcls lists the module
names and the catalog offset.

If path is a native GCOS ** file and -gcos is specified, then the
modules on the file are listed.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
