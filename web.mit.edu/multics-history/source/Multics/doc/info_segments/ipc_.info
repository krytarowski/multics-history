01/16/85  ipc_

The Multics system supports an interprocess communication facility.
The basic purpose of the facility is to provide control communication
(by means of stop and go signals) between processes.

The ipc_ subroutine is the user's interface to the Multics
interprocess communication facility where a process establishes event
channels in the current protection ring and waits for an event on one
or more channels.  For information on event channels, type "help
event_channel.gi".


Entry points in ipc_:
   (List is generated by the help command)


:Entry:  block:  10/22/82 ipc_$block


Function:  This entry point blocks the user's process until one or more
of a specified list of events has occurred.


Syntax:
declare ipc_$block entry (ptr, ptr, fixed bin(35));
call ipc_$block (event_wait_list_ptr, event_wait_info_ptr, code);


Arguments:
event_wait_list_ptr
   is a pointer to the event_wait_list structure that specifies the
   channels on which events are being awaited.  (Input) This structure
   is declared in event_wait_list.incl.pl1. Frequently ipc_$block is
   called with only one channel in the wait list.  In this case, the
   event_wait_channel structure can be used (declared in
   event_wait_channel.incl.pl1).
event_wait_info_ptr
   is a pointer to the event_wait_info structure into which the
   ipc_$block entry point can put information about the event that
   caused it to return (i.e., that awakened the process).  This
   structure is declared in event_wait_info.incl.pl1.  (Input)
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output)


:Entry:  create_ev_chn:  10/22/82 ipc_$create_ev_chn


Function:  This entry point creates an event-wait channel in the
current ring.


Syntax:
declare ipc_$create_ev_chn entry (fixed bin(71), fixed bin(35));
call ipc_$create_ev_chn (channel_id, code);


Arguments:
channel_id
   is the identifier of the event channel.  (Input)
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output)


:Entry:  cutoff:  01/16/85 ipc_$cutoff


Function:  This entry point inhibits the reading of events on a
specified event channel.  Any pending events are not affected.  More
can be received, but do not cause the process to wake up.


Syntax:
declare ipc_$cutoff entry (fixed bin(71), fixed bin(35));
call ipc_$cutoff (channel_id, code);


Arguments:
channel_id
   is the identifier of the event channel.  (Output)
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output)


:Entry:  decl_event_call_chn:  10/22/82 ipc_$decl_event_call_chn


Function:  This entry point changes an event-wait channel into an
event-call channel.


Syntax:
declare ipc_$decl_event_call_chn entry (fixed bin(71), entry, ptr,
     fixed bin, fixed bin(35));
call ipc_$decl_event_call_chn (channel_id, call_chn_procedure,
     data_ptr, priority, code);


Arguments:
channel_id
   is the identifier of the event channel.  (Input)
call_chn_procedure
   is the procedure entry point invoked when an event occurs on the
   specified channel.  (Input)  The procedure is called with one
   argument, a pointer to the event_call_info structure which is
   declared in event_call_info.incl.pl1.  Type "help event_channel.gi"
   for details.
data_ptr
   is a pointer to a region where data to be passed to and interpreted
   by that procedure entry point is placed.  (Input)


priority
   is a number indicating the priority of this event-call channel as
   compared to other event-call channels declared by this process for
   this ring.  If, upon interrogating all the appropriate event-call
   channels, more than one is found to have received an event, the
   lowest-numbered priority is honored first, and so on.  (Input)
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output)


:Entry:  decl_ev_wait_chn:  10/22/82 ipc_$decl_ev_wait_chn


Function:  This entry point changes an event-call channel into an
event-wait channel.


Syntax:
declare ipc_$decl_ev_wait_chn entry (fixed bin(71), fixed bin(35));

code
   is a standard status code.  (Output)


:Entry:  drain_chn:  10/22/82 ipc_$drain_chn


Function:  This entry point resets an event channel so that any pending
events (i.e., events that have been received but not processed for that
channel) are removed.


Syntax:
declare ipc_$drain_chn entry (fixed bin(71), fixed bin(35));
call ipc_$drain_chn (channel_id, code);

channel_id
   is the identifier of the event channel.  (Output)
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output)


:Entry:  mask_ev_calls:  10/22/82 ipc_$mask_ev_calls


Function: This entry point causes the ipc_$block entry point to
completely ignore event-calls occurring in the user's ring at the time
of this call.  This call causes a mask counter to be incremented.
Event calls are masked if this counter is greater than zero.


Syntax:
declare ipc_$mask_ev_calls entry (fixed bin(35));
call ipc_$mask_ev_calls (code);


Arguments:
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output)

   indicates whether an event occurred on the specified channel.
   (Output)
   0 no event occurred
   1 an event occurred
event_wait_info_ptr
   is a pointer to the event_wait_info structure into which the
   ipc_$block entry point can put information about the event that
   caused it to return (i.e., that awakened the process).  This
   structure is declared in event_wait_info.incl.pl1.  (Input)
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output)


:Entry:  reconnect:  10/22/82 ipc_$reconnect


Function: This entry point enables the reading of events on a
specified event channel for which reading had previously been
inhibited (using the ipc_$cutoff entry point).  All pending signals,
whether received before or during the time reading was inhibited, are
henceforth available for reading.


Syntax:
declare ipc_$reconnect entry (fixed bin(71), fixed bin(35));
call ipc_$reconnect (channel_id, code);


Arguments:
channel_id
   is the identifier of the event channel.  (Output)

:Entry:  set_call_prior:  10/22/82 ipc_$set_call_prior


Function:  This entry point causes event-call channels to be given
priority over event-wait channels when several channels are being
interrogated; e.g., upon return from being blocked and waiting on any
of a list of channels.  Only event channels in the current ring are
affected.  By default, event-call channels have priority.

call ipc_$set_call_prior (code);


Arguments:
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output)


:Entry:  set_wait_prior:  10/22/82 ipc_$set_wait_prior


Function:  This entry point causes event-wait channels to be given
priority over event-call channels when several channels are being
interrogated; e.g., when a process returns from being blocked and is
waiting on any of a list of channels.  Only event channels in the
current ring are affected.


Syntax:
declare ipc_$set_wait_prior entry (fixed bin(35));
call ipc_$set_wait_prior (code);


Arguments:
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output)


:Entry:  unmask_ev_calls:  10/22/82 ipc_$unmask_ev_calls


Function:  This entry point causes the event-call mask counter to be
decremented.  Event calls remain masked as long as the counter is
greater than zero.  To force event calls to become unmasked, call this
entry point repeatedly, until a nonzero code is returned.


Syntax:
declare ipc_$unmask_ev_calls entry (fixed bin(35));
call ipc_$unmask_ev_calls (code);

This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
