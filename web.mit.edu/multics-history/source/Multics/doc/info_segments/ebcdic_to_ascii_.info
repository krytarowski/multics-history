02/06/84  ebcdic_to_ascii_

The ebcdic_to_ascii_ subroutine performs isomorphic (one-to-one
reversible) conversion from EBCDIC to ASCII.  The input data is a
string of valid EBCDIC characters.  A valid EBCDIC character is defined
as a 9-bit byte with a hexadecimal value in the range
00 <= hex_value <= FF (octal value in the range
000 <= oct_value <= 377).

Calling the ebcdic_to_ascii_ subroutine is extremely efficient,
since conversion is performed by a single MVT instruction and the
procedure runs in the stack frame of its caller.


Entry points in ebcdic_to_ascii_:
   (List is generated by the help command)


:Entry: ebcdic_to_ascii_: 02/06/84  ebcdic_to_ascii_

Function: This entry point accepts an EBCDIC character string and
generates an ASCII character string of equal length.


Syntax:
declare ebcdic_to_ascii_ entry (char(*), char(*));
call ebcdic_to_ascii_ (ebcdic_in, ascii_out);


Arguments:
ebcdic_in
   is the string of EBCDIC characters to be converted.  (Input)
ascii_out
   is the ASCII equivalent of the input string.  (Output)


:Entry:  ea_table:  02/06/84 ebcdic_to_ascii_$ea_table


Function:  This entry point defines the 256-character translation table
used to perform conversion from EBCDIC to ASCII.


Syntax:
declare ebcdic_to_ascii_$ea_table char(256) external static;


Notes: Of the 256 valid EBCDIC characters, only 128 have ASCII
equivalents.  These latter 128 characters are defined in the
Isomorphic ASCII/EBCDIC Conversion Table (in the Subroutines manual.)

For defined characters, the mappings implemented by the
ebcdic_to_ascii_ and ascii_to_ebcdic_ subroutines are isomorphic;
i.e., each character has a unique mapping, and mappings are
reversible.  An undefined (but valid) EBCDIC character is mapped into
the ASCII SUB (substitute) character, octal 032; the mapping of such a
character is anisomorphic.  The result of converting an invalid
character is undefined.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
