11/01/76  page_trace, pgt

Syntax:  pgt {N} {-control_args}


Function: prints a recent history of page faults and other system events within
the calling process.


Arguments: 
N
   print last N system events. (DEFAULT-- print all events in trace list.)


Control arguments: 
-long, -lg
   print full pathname where appropriate. (DEFAULT -- entrynames only.)
-no_header, -nhe
   do not print header preceding output.
-from STR, -fm STR
   start printing at first user-marker matching STR.
-to STR
   stop printing at first user-marker matching STR.
-output_switch swname, -os swname
   write output on swname, which must be attached and open.
-no_pagefaults, -npf
   omit output about pagefaults.


Notes: Segment numbers can be reused within a process. Since it is the segment
numbers that are stored in the trace list, the pathnames and entrynames printed
by pgt may correspond to present initiations of a segment as opposed to those
in effect when the fault was recorded in the trace list.
  Typically, any single invocation of a program does not produce a pagefault on
every page referenced by the program. Several traces may be needed to fully
identify the extent of pages used. The cumulative_page_trace (cpt) command is
useful for this purpose.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
