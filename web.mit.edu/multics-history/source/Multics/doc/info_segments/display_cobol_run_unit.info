Syntax:  dcr {-control_args}


Function:	 displays the current state of a COBOL run unit.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   prints information about all programs in the run unit, including
   those that have been cancelled.
-files
   displays information about the current state of the files that have
   been referenced during the execution of the current run unit.
-long, -lg
   displays more detailed information about each COBOL program in the
   run unit.


Notes:  The minimal information displayed tells which programs compose
the run unit.  Optionally, more detailed information can be displayed
concerning active files, data location, and other aspects of the run
unit.  Refer to the run_cobol command for information concerning the

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
