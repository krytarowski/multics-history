10/17/84  stop_cobol_run, scr

Syntax as a command:  scr {-control_arg}


Function: terminates the current COBOL run unit.


Control arguments:
-retain_data, -retd
   leaves the data segments associated with the programs of the run
   unit intact for debugging purposes (see "Notes").


Notes: The results of stop_cobol_run and the execution of the STOP RUN
statement from within a COBOL program are identical.  Stopping the run
unit consists of cleaning up all files that have been opened during the
execution of the current run unit and ensuring that the next time a
program that was a component of this run unit is invoked its data is in
its initial state.

To maintain the value of all data referenced in the run unit in its
last used state, use -retain_data.

Refer to the run_cobol command for information concerning the run unit
and the COBOL runtime environment.  See also the cancel_cobol_program
and display_cobol_run_unit commands.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
