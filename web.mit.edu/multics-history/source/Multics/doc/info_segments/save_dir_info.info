10/17/84  save_dir_info

Syntax as a command:  save_dir_info dir_path {seg_path}


Function:  creates a segment containing all information available from
the storage system about a directory and its contents.


Arguments:
dir_path
   is the pathname of the directory to be scanned.
seg_path
   is the pathname of the directory information segment to be created.
   If you omit seg_path, the entryname portion of dir_path is assumed.
   If seg_path does not end with the dir_info suffix, it is assumed.


Notes:  This command is not recursive; the entire subtree inferior to
the selected directory is not scanned, just the immediately inferior
branches and links.  The saved information segment can be processed by
the comp_dir_info and list_dir_info commands.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
