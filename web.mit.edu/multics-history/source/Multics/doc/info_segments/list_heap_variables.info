05/12/86  list_heap_variables, lhv

Syntax:  lhv names {-control_args}


Function: Prints information concerning heap variables.  Only
variables at the specified execution level(s) are printed.  The
default information is the location and size of each specified
variable.  A level description is printed for each execution level
specified.  The heap variables will be displayed starting at the
lowest execution level specified.


Arguments:
names
   are names of external variables, separated by spaces.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   prints information for all heap levels. Starting at execution
   level 0 and ending with the current execution level.
-brief, -bf
   prints out the variable name, size and where it is allocated.
   (Default)
-long, -lg
   prints how and when the variables were allocated.
-header, -he
   forces the header to be printed. (Default).
-no_header, -nhe
   suppresses the printing of the header.


-to level
   specifies what execution level to stop printing variables at.
   If not present the current execution level is assumed.
-from level, -fm level
   specifies what execution level to start printing variables at.
   If not present execution level 0 is assumed.


Notes: The -from and -to arguments are meant to be used together to
specify a range of execution levels to be printed. If neither are
present the current execution level is assumed.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
