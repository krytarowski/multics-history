08/02/84  gcos_tss, gtss

Syntax as a command:  gtss


Function:  The gcos_tss command invokes the GTSS to run a single GCOS
time sharing user in the user's process.


Notes:  All parameters controlling the operation of gcos_tss are set
with the gcos_set_environment command.  If gtss is invoked with no
prior call to gcos_set_environment, the following values are assumed:

-drm wd -modes ast,^drl,^gbd,^mcmd,^mquit,^ss

The gtss SAVE command will not set the bit counts on segments created
via this command, since they are not needed by the simulator.  If,
however, the user wishes to manipulate the files via programs external
to the simulator (such as gcos_card_utility), the bit counts must first
be set modulo 320 words.

The gtss command may not be invoked while the caller is using
window_call (video mode).  The GTSS subsystems cannot handle the
special I/O required to support this terminal interface.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
