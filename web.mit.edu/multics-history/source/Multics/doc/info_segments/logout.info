02/15/85  logout

Syntax as a command:  logout {-control_args}


Function: terminates your session and ends communication with the
Multics system.  It signals the finish condition for the process and,
after the default on unit for the finish condition returns, closes all
open files and destroys the process.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   prints neither the logout message nor, if you give -hold, the login
   message.
-hold, -hd
   terminates your session but not communication with the system: you
   can immediately log in without redialing.


Notes: If your site is security conscious, it may have disabled
"logout -hold"; in this case if you wish to change authorization, do
this:
   1. log out
   2. verify, using terminal/modem indications, that the terminal has
      dropped DTR and that the system acknowledged by dropping DSR
   3. log in at the new authorization.


This procedure is the only way to guarantee that you are communicating
with the answering service and not with a Trojan horse.

DTR and DSR are EIA RS232 control signals that are part of the
interface between your terminal and the system.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
