01/24/84  Damaged Segments

If a device error or system crash causes a page of a segment to be
destroyed, the supervisor sets a special switch associated with the
segment called the damaged switch.  An attempt to reference the
contents of a segment whose damaged switch is on causes an error with
the message:

    Entry has been damaged. Please type "help damaged_segments.gi".

Two cases can occur.  Sometimes, the only valid copy of a page of the
segment was destroyed; if so, a page of zeroes appears in the segment.
In other, rare, cases, a modified page of a segment cannot be written
out due to a paging device error; when this occurs, the original
unmodifed page may be supplied.


When a damaged segment is detected, the owner of the segment should
change the ACL of the segment so that no other user can reference it,
and then reset the damaged switch using the switch_off command.  The
owner should then inspect the segment's contents to determine the
extent of the damage.  If the damage is easily correctable, the user
can simply fix the segment and continue.  Otherwise, the segment
should be retrieved from the last known good copy.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
