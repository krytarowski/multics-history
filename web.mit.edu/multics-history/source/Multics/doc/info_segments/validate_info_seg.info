85-10-10	validate_info_seg, vis

Syntax as a command:  vis paths {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [vis paths {-control_args}]


Function:	 validates the syntax of an info segment.  The active
function returns the number of the highest severity error that
occurs.


Arguments:
paths
   are the pathnames of info segs.  The info suffix need not be
   supplied.  The star convention is allowed.


Control arguments:
-names, -nm
   changes the names on the info segment, if necessary, to match the
   names used in it.
-no_names, -nnm
   does not change the names on the info segment to match the names
   used in it, but merely reports discrepancies.  (Default)
-severity N, -sv N
   suppresses error messages of severity less than N.
-total, -tt
   prints only the total number of errors for each severity, or nothing
   if there are no errors.


Notes on validation: The validate_info_seg (vis) command validates the
syntax of an info segment.  For a description of info segment format,
type "help info_seg.gi".  Error messages printed by vis are of four
severities:
       Severity 4 -- bad errors precluding installation
       Severity 3 -- less important errors
       Severity 2 -- even less important errors
       Severity 1 -- just warnings, such as the existence of
                     nonstandard section headings.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
