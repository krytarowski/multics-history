memo doesn't know and can't ever know that a repeat of 2weeks
represents either 335 hours, 336 hours, or 337 hours, depending on the
happening of a standard/daylight zone change during that period.

decimal_date_time_ and request_id_ typically differ by sereral hours in
the strings they return.

This is true, request_id_ is always in GMT while decimal_date_time_ is
in the default zone.  There is no documentation on either of these, so
there is no way to tell if they both are fulfilling their contract.
   This will soon be a moot point, since the 5-6 users of
decimal_date_time_ will be changed to do something else and then
decimal_date_time_ will go away.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
