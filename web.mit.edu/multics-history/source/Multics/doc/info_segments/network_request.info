07/29/83  network_request, nr

Syntax:
   nr l6_ftf source_path destination_path -net net_name {-control_args}


Function:  allows the user to interactively transfer files to or from a
Level 6 X.25 Satellite.


Arguments:
source_path
   designates the source file to be used for the transfer.  The format
   is:

         {-name} file_name {-at host}

   where file_name must be preceded by -name (or -nm) if it begins with
   a "-" to distinguish it from a control argument.  It must be
   enclosed in quotes if it contains spaces or special characters.  It
   must be followed by "-at host" if the file does not reside on the
   local host.  The file_name is specified in a syntax acceptable to
   the host on which the file resides; if supplied, the host argument
   must be the address of the Level 6 host on the X.25 network.  If the
   file resides on Multics, an arbitrary star name can be used.  If the
   file resides on a Level 6, then the name "**" can be used to
   transfer all of the files in a directory on the Level 6.


destination_path
   specifies the destination file to be used for the transfer.  The
   format is:

         {-name} file_name {-at host}

   It has the same syntax and restrictions as source_path.  The equal
   convention is supported.


Control arguments:
-attended, -att
   specifies that the Level 6 already has a server running and no login
   dialogue is needed.
-brief, -bf
   does not print messages as the command executes.

-data_type ascii
-data_type binary
-data_type bcd
   specifies the data type of the Multics file.  If binary, then the
   Multics file must be sequential or blocked; it can not be
   unstructured.  The default is ascii.
-long, -lg
   prints a message when the transfer starts and when it is finished,
   giving the pathnames, records transfered, etc.  (Default)


-network_name NAME, -net NAME
   specifies the channel name of the X.25 channel (i.e.  the network
   "name") to be used for the transfer.  This control argument is
   required.
-not_attended, -natt
   specifies that a login dialogue is needed with the Level 6 to
   initiate the transfer.  (Default)
-password STR, -pw STR
   specifies the password used by the remote host to authenticate the
   file transfer.  There is no default.  If the remote host requires a
   password and none is given, then the user is prompted for one with a
   mask.
-user STR
   STR specifies the user on whose behalf the file transfer is to be
   done.  This can be used by the remote host for authentication of the
   file transfer.  The default is the Multics User_id of the user who
   submitted the request.


Access required:  The user must have the "dialok" attribute and have rw
access to the X.25 channel specified by -net.


Notes:  There is a restriction that either the source file or the
destination file must be on the local host (i.e.  both must not use the
-at argument).  Thus, third-party transfers are not allowed.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
