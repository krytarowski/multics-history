10/20/86  make_list, mkls


Syntax as a command:  mkls path -control_args


Function:  creates a nonprintable empty lister file upon which document
processing is performed.  (Also see the description of the create_list
command, which creates a lister file using an ASCII input file.)


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the lister file to be made.  Lister must be the
   last component of the lister file name; however, if path does not
   have a suffix of lister, one is assumed.


Control arguments:
-delimiter rf, -dm rf
   sets the record delimiter used in the lister file to r, and the
   field delimiter used in the lister file to f.  Both r and f must be
   exactly one character long and be chosen from:

        ! # $ % & * = ? @ ^ | ~

   and each must be a different character.  If this control argument is
   omitted, the record delimiter, by default, is the dollar character
   ($), and the field delimiter, by default, is the equal character
   (=).
-field_name name1 ...  nameN, -fn name1 ...  nameN
   sets the names of the fields in the created lister file to name1
   through nameN.  Each name must begin with an alphabetic character
   and consist of alphanumeric characters.  No two names can be the
   same.  This control argument is required.


Notes:  The make_list command sets the "lister" severity indicator.  A
severity of 2 is set when the lister file is not created or the
invocation of make_list terminates abnormally.  A severity of 0 is set
when the lister file is successfully created.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
