07/08/80  make_pps_tape

Syntax: make_pps_tape target_spec paths


Function: allows a user to make a tape to be printed on the PPS


Arguments:
target_desc
   either "-volume volname" or "-vol volname" to specify the tape
   volume; or "-target_description attach_description" or "-tds
   attach_description to specify the target attach description.
path
   is the pathname of a segment to be printed on the PPS.


Notes: make_pps_tape attaches the output tape using either the attach
   description provided by the user or one of the form "pps_ -vol XX"
   where XX was specified as the volume name by the user.  The -tds
   control argument must be used when control arguments other than
   -vol are desired in the attach description.
   
   Each pathname specified in the command line is written as a
   separate report on the output tape.
   
   make_pps_tape does not produce PPS control blocks on the output
   tape.  For this reason the user must inform the PPS operator as to
   the paramaters to be used in printing the information on the tape.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
