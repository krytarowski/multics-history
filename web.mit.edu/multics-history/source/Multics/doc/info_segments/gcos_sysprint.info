07/25/84  gcos_sysprint, gsp

Syntax as a command:  gsp input_path {output_path} {-control_arg}


Function:  The gcos_sysprint command converts a print file (either
SYSOUT or simulated printer) produced by the GCOS environment simulator
from GCOS ASCII or BCD to Multics ASCII for printing or viewing on a
terminal.  This command is called automatically by the simulator to
convert any print files produced by the job, unless the -hold option is
given on the gcos command line.  It can also be called by the user to
convert a file that was not converted automatically.


Arguments:
input_path
   is the pathname of a print file produced by the simulator.
output_path
   is the pathname of a file into which the ASCII output lines are to
   be written.  If the file already exists, it is overwritten with no
   warning.  If output_path is omitted, the lines are displayed on the
   user's terminal as they are converted.


Control arguments:
-lower_case, -lc
   translates alphabetic characters to lowercase ASCII.  (Default is
   uppercase)


Notes:  The star and equal conventions are not implemented in this
command.

If the first record in the file is the SYSOUT header record written by
the simulator, then the records are ordered by report code (within each
activity) before being printed, and all records from the execution
report are printed first.  Otherwise the records are printed in the
order in which they appear in the input file, with no sorting or
reordering of any kind.

The records are assumed to be GCOS print line images, ending with GCOS
printer control characters.  These latter are converted to ASCII
newline and newpage characters.  To convert a BCD card image file to
ASCII, with newline characters being added to the end of each line, use
the gcos_card_utility command.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
