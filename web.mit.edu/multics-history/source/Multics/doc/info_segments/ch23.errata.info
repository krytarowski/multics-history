     (this example also employs the subject request), and

          send_mail:  !append [sj]


pgs A-2, A-7, A-54:  add the following Note at the end of the
     ARGUMENTS sections for "print_mail", "read_mail" and
     "send_mail."

     Note:  if the mbx_specification (mbx_specification address)
     is a pathname, and that pathname does not contain a "<" or
     ">" character, read_mail (send_mail, print_mail) searches
     for the pathname using the mail_system search list.  The
     default content of the search list is the following:

         -working_dir
         -home_dir
         >udd>[user_project]>[user name]>[user name].mlsys


A-27, A-73:  under "exec_com path {args}" change the search list
     from

     -working_dir
     >udd>[user_project]>[user name]>[user name].mlsys

   to

     -working_dir
     -home_dir
     >udd>[user_project]>[user name]>[user name].mlsys

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
