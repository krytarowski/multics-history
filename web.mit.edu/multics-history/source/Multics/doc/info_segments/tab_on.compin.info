02/20/80	tab_on.compin

Syntax:  .ifi tab_on


Function:
This compose macro enables the generation of a list of Tables for the
Table of Contents.


Notes:
1) If this macro is used in <file>.compin, the desired list of Tables
   is accumulated in a segment named <file>.tab.compin.
2) The macro need be used only once for a document, but its repeated
   use does no harm and the segment accumulating the list is not
   changed.  If <book>.compin is a "driver" file that inserts
   <file>.compin as a section and both use this macro, the list of
   Tables for <file>.compin will be added to <book>.tab.compin.
3) The macro assumes that the Table of Contents is also enabled and
   formats <file>.tab.compin in such a way that it may be appended to
   <file>.toc.compin (see toc_on.info).
4) See tab.info, tab_get_no.info, and tab_index.info for related
   information.


   Example:
   The following is a sample "book" compin segment named
   AAnn_book.compin.

        .ifi init_mpm "AAnn"
        .ifi toc_on
        .ifi fig_on
        .ifi tab_on
        .ifi AAnn.tp
        .ifi AAnn.pf
        .ifi s1
        .ifi s2
	    .
	    .
	    .
        .ifi AAnn-book.toc
        .ifi AAnn_book.fig
        .ifi AAnn_book.tab

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
