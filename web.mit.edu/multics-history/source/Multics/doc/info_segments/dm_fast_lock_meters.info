03/26/85 dm_fast_lock_meters

Syntax:  dm_fast_lock_meters {-control_args}


Function:  This command displays metering information about Data Management
fast locking.


Control arguments:
-reset, -rs
   resets the meters to zero and suppresses reporting.
-report_reset, -rr
   reports the current meters then resets them.


Notes:  Data Management fast locking maintains a list of blocks where a block
can contain information on the fast lock or on the waiter of a fast lock.
Adding a block to this list is considered threading in, and removing a block is
considered threading out.  It is possible that an attempt is being made to
thread a block in or out and another process changes the list first.  In this
case the attempt must be retried; each attempt is called a step.


Examples:
!  dm_fast_lock_meters

  Total metering time:  4:19:51

  Fast lock or waiter block:
  thread in calls / steps     thread out calls / steps
               10      12                    9       9

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
