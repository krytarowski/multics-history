:Entry:  ascii_to_bcd_:  09/30/83 ascii_to_bcd_


Function:  performs isomorphic conversion from ASCII to BCD.


Syntax:
dcl ascii_to_bcd_ entry (char(*), bit(*));
call ascii_to_bcd_ (ascii_in, bcd_out);


Arguments:
ascii_in
   is the ascii input characters to convert to BCD. (Input)
bcd_out
   is the BCD equivalent of the input string.  Note that both upper
   and lower case ASCII characters are converted to the single case
   BCD characters.  ASCII characters that do not have a match in BCD
   will be converted to a question mark (?). For more information see
   "Notes" below. (Output)


Notes:  The ASCII question mark (?) and any ASCII characters (other
than lowercase letters) will be mapped into a BCD question mark (?).
Lowercase letters will be mapped into the equivalent uppercase letter.
The valid BCD characters are as follows:

0123456789[@:?ABCDEFGHI&.](<\^JKLMNOPQR-$*);'+/STUVWXYZ_,%=!#<space>

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
