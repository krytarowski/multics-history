08/02/84  quiesce_mrds_db, qmdb

Syntax as a command:  qmdb database_path {-control_args}


Function:  This DBA tool quiesces a given data base, or frees it from
being quiesced, for such purposes as data base backup or other
exclusive activities that require a consistent and non-active data
base.


Arguments:
database_path
   is the pathname of the data base to be quiesced or freed.


Control arguments:
-free
   causes the data base to be freed from a quiesced state.
-quiet
   causes the data base to be quiesced.  (Default)
-wait_time N, -wt N
   sets the amount of time that an attempt to quiesce waits for
   conflicting data base users to depart before failing (see "Notes").


Notes:  Time (N) for -wait_time is in seconds.  A long wait time is
needed if a display_mrds_db_status shows many users; otherwise, a short
wait time will suffice.  The default wait time is zero seconds.

The control args -quiet and -free are mutually exclusive, as are -free
and -wait_time.

Only the quiescing process may open a quiesced data base.  Only a DBA
can use this command.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
