11/24/86  create_mrds_dm_include, cmdmi

Syntax as a command:  cmdmi path {-control_args}


Function:  This command is a MRDS data model/submodel display tool that
creates an include segment suitable for use in accessing the data base
from PL/I programs via the dsl_ subroutine interface.  Comments are put
in the include file to indicate indexed and key attributes.


Arguments:
path
   is the relative or absolute pathname of the data base model or
   submodel, with or without suffix.  It requires "r" ACL to the data
   model.  If the data base is secured, then the path must refer to a
   submodel in the secure.submodels directory under the data base,
   unless the user is a DBA.  If a suffix is not supplied and both a
   model and submodel exist in the same directory, then the model is
   found before the submodel.


Control arguments:
-based
   specifies that the resulting include file structure declaration has
   the "based" PL/I attribute.
-no_based
   specifies that the resulting include file structure declaration does
   not have the based attribute.  (Default)
-order rel_name1 rel_name2...rel_namei
   specifies that the structures generated for the relations whose
   names follow this argument are to be placed first in the output
   segment in the order of their names on the command line.  The
   structures for relations not named in the ordered list are placed at
   the end of the output segment in the order in which their names are
   defined in the data model.  The names following the -order control
   argument are separated by spaces.

-output_file filename, -of filename
    specifies the name to be assigned to the output segment.
-page_length N, -pl N
   specifies the number of lines allowed between form-feed characters
   in the output segment, where N=0 or 30<=N<=127.  A page length of 0
   puts a form feed before each structure.  (Default is 59 lines)
-relation rel_name1 rel_name2...rel_namei,
     -rel rel_name1 rel_name2...rel_namei
   specifies the names of the relations for which the display is to
   be created.  The relations will appear in the output segment in the
   order specified.  The names following -rel are separated by spaces.
   The -rel control argument is incompatible with -order.


Notes:  The output is written to a segment whose name is constructed as
follows:

     <entryname of the input path with the db or dsm suffix
        removed>.incl.pl1

   or, if -output_file is specified:

     <filename>.incl.pl1

If the segment does not exist, it is created.

If the data base is secured and the user is not a DBA, then the "key"
comment on attributes is changed to "indexed" for the key head
attribute and remaining key attributes have no comments.

If a -decode_declare option exists on an attribute domain, then the
declaration appears in the include file since this is the user view and
the data base storage data type is not of use.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
