07/25/86  terminate, tm

Syntax as a command:  tm paths


Function: removes a segment or MSF from your address space and resets
links to the terminated file. It is commonly used prior to initiating
a different version of a program.


Arguments:
paths
   are pathnames of files to be terminated.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the error message printed when a file to be terminated
   is not known (initiated).
-long, -lg
   does not suppress the above error message.  (Default)
-name STR, -nm STR
   specifies an entryname STR that begins with a minus sign, to
   distinguish it from a control argument.


Notes: Be careful not to unintentionally terminate a segment of the
command language interpreter or another critical piece of the
environment.  Fatal process errors usually result from such an action.

The star convention is not recognized.

Terminating a multisegment file will terminate only component 0 of the
MSF unless it is an object MSF, in which case all of the components will
be terminated.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
