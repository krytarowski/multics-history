01/03/83	display_pnotice

Syntax:  display_pnotice path {control_arg}


Function: The display_pnotice command is used to provide information
on software protection notices contained in source programs.  By
default, the primary names of protection notices are printed instead
of the entire notice text.  Archives of source code programs may be
audited for protection notices using this command if path includes the
full archive name.  If a source module does not contain any notices,
or contains conflicting notices (e.g., copyright and trade secret), an
error message is emitted.  A warning message is also printed if there
is an imbedded notice found in a source program (protection notices
should be the first comment encountered).


Arguments:
path
   This is the full or relative pathname of the source language module.
   The language suffix must be included, or the archive suffix if an
   entire archive is to be processed.  The archive pathname convention
   is supported.


Control arguments:
-long, -lg
   If this control argument is used, the full text of notices found
   will be displayed.

-brief, -bf
    This is the default. Instead of text of notices found, the primary
    name of notices, without the "pnotice" suffix, is printed.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
