:Entry: char_to_numeric_: 01/31/83  char_to_numeric_


Function: converts a user-supplied string to a numeric type, or
signals the conversion condition if it cannot be converted.  The
attributes of the numeric data created are returned.


Syntax:
declare char_to_numeric_ entry (ptr, fixed bin(35), fixed bin(35), ptr,
     fixed bin(21));
call char_to_numeric_ (target_ptr, enc_type, enc_prec, source_ptr,
     source_len);


Arguments:
target_ptr
   points to a buffer where the numeric data may be written.  No check
   is made that the buffer is large enough to hold the data.  (Input)
enc_type
   is the encoded type of the data created.  Its value is 2*M+P, where
   M is a standard Multics type code, and P is 1 if the data is packed,
   or 0 if it is not.  (P should always be 0.)  The value of Multics
   type codes are defined in the Programmer's Reference Manual.
   (Output)


enc_prec
   is the encoded precision of the data created.  The format of an
   encoded precision is given by encoded_precision.incl.pl1.  See the
   description of the assign_ subroutine.  (Output)
source_ptr
   points to the character string to convert to numeric.  (Input)
source_len
   is the number of characters in the input string.  (Input)

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
