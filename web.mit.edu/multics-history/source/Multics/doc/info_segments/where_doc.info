08/07/86  where_doc, wdoc

Syntax as a command:  wdoc topic_name {-control_args}


Function: returns the names of manuals that contain information about
the specified topic name.


Arguments:
topic_name
   is the name of a topic, command, subroutine, or I/O module.  Use
   iteration to get more than one topic.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   prints all the sections of manual information.
-allow_partial_matches, -apm
   searches for a partial match of the topic name if an exact match is
   not found.
-audience, -aud
   describes the audience for which the manual is intended.
-database_pathname PATH, -dbpn PATH
   specifies the pathname of the data base you want instead of the
   default one.  Once you supply -database_pathname, the specified data
   base is used for all subsequent invocations of where_doc during your
   process until you select another data base.


-description, -desc
   returns a brief description of the manual's contents.
   (Default)
-dont_allow_partial_matches, -dapm
   does not allow partial matches.  (Default)
-new_features, -nf
   lists all new features that have been added to the manual with the
   last update (revision or addendum).
-no_audience, -no_aud
   does not describe the manual's intended audience.  (Default)
-no_description, -no_desc
   suppresses printing of the brief description of the manual's
   contents.
-no_new_features, -no_nf
   does not list new features.  (Default)


-no_table_of_contents, -no_toc
   does not print the manual's table of contents.  (Default)
-output_file PATH, -of PATH
   directs the output to a file instead of to your terminal.
-table_of_contents, -toc
   prints the manual's table of contents.


Notes: If you can't find a match for topic_name and didn't select
-allow_partial_matches or -dont_allow_partial_matches, you are asked
whether or not you want where_doc to search for partial matches.

When you use a control argument giving additional information about the
manuals found (e.g., -audience or -table_of_contents) and where_doc
finds more than one manual with information about the topic_name, a
menu containing the names of the manuals is displayed.  You can then
choose to see the information on one or more of the manuals listed or
return to command level.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
