07/24/84  use_symbols, usb

Syntax as a command:  usb path


Function:  The use_symbols command sets the current symbol dictionary.
All Speedtype commands then use this symbol dictionary.  If this symbol
dictionary does not exist, the user is asked if it should be created.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the symbol dictionary that is to be the new
   current symbol dictionary.  If path does not have a suffix of
   symbols, one is assumed; however, symbols must be the last component
   of the symbols dictionary segment name.


Notes:  If other Speedtype commands are issued in a user's process
before the use_symbols command, then those commands use the default
symbol dictionary in the user's home directory.  The default symbol
dictionary has the pathname:

    >udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.symbols

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
