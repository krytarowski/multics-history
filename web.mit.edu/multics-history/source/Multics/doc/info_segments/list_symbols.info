Function:  The list_symbols command lists one, or several, or all of
the symbols defined in the current symbol dictionary.


Arguments:
symbols
   are optional arguments that specify the symbols to list.  If any
   given symbol is not found, then a message is printed stating that
   the symbol is not defined.  If no symbols are specified, then all
   symbols in the current symbol dictionary are listed.  The list is in
   ASCII collating sequence order.


Control arguments:
-long, -lg
   specifies that for each symbol listed, its expansion string with
   suffixing is listed for each suffix enabled for that symbol.
-option, -op
   specifies that all option information for the current symbol
   dictionary is to be listed (see the option_symbols command for a
   description of option information).  If this is the only control
   argument specified, then only the option information is listed.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
