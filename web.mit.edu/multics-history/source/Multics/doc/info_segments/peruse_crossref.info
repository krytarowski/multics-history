02/18/85  peruse_crossref, pcref

Syntax as a command:  pcref {cref_path} search_names {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [pcref {cref_path} search_names]


Function: prints or returns information extracted from the output file
generated by the cross_reference command.


Arguments:
cref_path
   is the pathname of the crossref output file to search.  It can be a
   multisegment file (MSF).  It must contain a > or < character to
   distinguish it from a search_name.  If you supply no cref_path, the
   total system cross-reference (>ldd>crossref>total.crossref) is used.
   To specify a cross-reference in your working directory, use
   -pathname.
search_names
   are one or more names to search for references to in the crossref.
   They can be either symbolic linker references or include file names
   and can have any of the following forms:
      segname
      segname$entryname
      XXX.incl.YYY


   Any component of a search name can be a star name, except that
   neither a segname nor an include file name can begin with a star
   name character and the string ".incl" must appear in toto.  If you
   specify no entryname with the segname, all references to any entry
   points in the segment are listed.  XXX.incl is accepted as an
   abbreviation for XXX.incl.*.  Don't use > and < in a search name.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   does not print any information for selected cross-reference items
   that have no entries (callers).  (Default)
-brief_errors, -bfe
   suppreses any error messages due to entrypoints or include files
   that are not found in the crossref.
-long, -lg
   print selected cross-reference items that have no entries.
-long_errors, -lge
   prints an error message if one or more entrypoints or include files
   given on the command line are not found in the crossref.  (Default)
-pathname crossref path, -pn crossref path
   specifies crossref path as the crossref to search.


Notes: This command uses a binary search to locate the desired
information and thus is quite inexpensive, even when searching the
total system crossref.  Average cost for a single search of the system
crossref is about 45 page faults and 0.5 CPU seconds, or roughly 30
times cheaper and far more convenient than using an editor.

No attempt is made to combine the results of the search names--if you
ask for something twice, it gets printed twice.

This command does not perform any significant validation on the input
filen and is likely to either take faults or signal the logic_error
condition if asked to search something other than a crossref output
file.


There is no support for synonyms--a search name must be the primary
name of a segment and not a synonym established in a bindfile or the
hardcore header.

There is no way to select specific types of things, such as all the
unresolvable references in the crossref.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
