08/01/84  gcos_label_tape, gclt

Syntax as a command:  gclt reel_num {new_num} {-control_args}


Function:  The gcos_label_tape command writes a GCOS label on a tape.


Arguments:
reel_num
   is the number on the label of the tape reel to be used.
new_num
   is the new serial number to be written on the tape.  If it is the
   same as the reel_num, it may be omitted.


Control arguments:
-density N, -den N
   where N specifies the tape density.  (Default is 1600 bpi)
-erase
   erases the tape before labeling it.  Default is to overwrite the old
   label (if it exists), and leave the remaining data intact.
-no_erase
   does not erase the tape before labeling it.  (Default)
-track N, -tk N:  where N specifies 7- or 9-track tape.  (Default is
   9-track)


Notes:  If no control arguments are given, the command:
     gclt xyz12
is equivalent to the command:
     gclt xyz12 xyz12 -tk 9 -den 1600 -no_erase
If conflicting control arguments are given, the rightmost control
argument is used (e.g., "gclt m1266 -tk 7 -tk 9" results in a 9-track
tape label.)

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
