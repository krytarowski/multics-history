02/11/85  delete_dir, dd

Syntax as a command:  dd {paths} {-control_args}


Function: deletes the specified directories and any segments, links,
multisegment files, data management files, and extended entries they
contain.  All inferior directories and their contents are also deleted.
Use the delete command to delete segments and the unlink command to
delete link entries.


Arguments:
paths
   are pathnames of directories.  The star convention is allowed.


Control arguments:
-absolute_pathname, -absp
   prints the entire pathname of the entries listed by -long,
   -query_all, and -query_each.
-brief, -bf
   inhibits the printing of an error message if the directory to be
   deleted is not found.
-entryname, -etnm
   prints only the entrynames of the entries listed by -long,
   -query_all, and -query_each.  (Default)
-force, -fc
   deletes the specified directories without issuing a query.
-long, -lg
   prints a message of the form "Deleted directory <path>" for each
   directory deleted.


-name STR, -nm STR
   specifies a nonstandard entryname STR (e.g., invalid starname such
   as **.**.compout or name that contains <.)
-query_all, -qya
   lists all directories to be deleted, and issues one query for all of
   them.
-query_each, -qye
   issues a query for each directory being deleted.  (Default)


Access required: You must have modify permission on both the directory
and its superior directory.


Notes: At least one path or -name must be given.

If -force is not supplied, delete_dir asks you whether to delete the
specified directory; it is then deleted only if you type "yes."  When
deleting a nonempty master directory, or a directory containing
inferior nonempty master directories, you must have previously mounted
the logical volume(s).  If a nonempty master directory for an unmounted
volume is encountered, no subtrees of that master directory are
deleted, even if they are mounted.

When you are deleting a directory containing data management files, you
can't delete those files if a transaction is still pending.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
