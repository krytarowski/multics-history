:Entry: adjust_bit_count_: 02/13/84  adjust_bit_count_

Function: finds the last nonzero word or character of a segment or
multisegment file and sets the bit count accordingly.  In the case of
a multisegment file, empty trailing components are deleted and the
returned bit count is the sum of the bit counts of the nonzero
components.  Only the bit count of the last component is altered.
This subroutine performs the basic work of the adjust_bit_count
command.


Syntax:
declare adjust_bit_count_ entry (char(168) aligned, char(32) aligned,
     bit(1) aligned, fixed bin(35), fixed bin(35));
call adjust_bit_count_ (dir_name, entryname, char_sw, bit_count, code);


Arguments:
dir_name
   is the pathname of the containing directory.  (Input)
entryname
   is the entryname of the segment.  (Input)
char_sw
   is the character switch.  (Input)
   "0"b   adjusts to last bit of last nonzero word.
   "1"b   adjusts to last bit of last nonzero character.


bit_count
   is the computed bit count for the segment.  (Output) If the value is
   less than 0, it indicates that no attempt to compute the count was
   made (code is nonzero).  If the value is greater than or equal to 0,
   the computed value is correct, whether or not the bit count could be
   set.
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output)

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
