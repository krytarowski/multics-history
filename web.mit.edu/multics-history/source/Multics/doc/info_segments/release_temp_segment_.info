:Entry: release_temp_segment_: 09/25/86  release_temp_segment_

Function: returns a temporary segment (acquired with the
get_temp_segment_ or the get_temp_segments_ subroutine) to the free
pool of temporary segments associated with the process.  Through the
pool concept, temporary segments can be used more than once during the
life of a process.  Since the process does not have to create a new
segment each time one is needed, overhead costs are decreased.


Syntax:
declare release_temp_segment_ entry (char(*), ptr, fixed bin(35));
call release_temp_segment_ (program, temp_seg_ptr, code);


Arguments:
program
   is a 32-character field identifying the program on whose behalf the
   temporary segment is to be used.  This field is displayed by the
   list_temp_segments command.  Besides giving the name of the command
   or subroutine invoked by the user, it can also briefly describe how
   the temporary segment is used; for example, "sort_seg (sort
   indexes)."  (Input)
temp_seg_ptr
   is a pointer to the temporary segment being released. (Input/Output)
   It is set to null after the segment is successfully returned to the
   free pool.  This fact can be used by callers to determine if a given
   temporary segment has been released.  A null input value is not
   treated as an error; no action is performed.
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output)


Notes:  A nonzero status code is returned if the segment being released
was not assigned to the given program.  See the description of the
get_temp_segment_ or the get_temp_segments_ subroutine for a
description of how to acquire a temporary segment.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
