02/24/84  change_tuning_parameters, ctp

Syntax: ctp name1 value1 {... nameN valueN} {-control_args}


Function: changes the values of system tuning parameters.


Arguments:
name
   is the name of a tuning parameter whose value is to be changed.  It
   can be either the long or short name of the parameter.
value
   is the representation of the value the tuning parameter is to be set
   to. It may be an integer, a decimal number of seconds, either of
   "on" or "off", a decimal number, or a full-word octal value.  The
   data type of the value depends on the individual tuning parameter
   being set.


Control arguments:
-silent
   causes the message normally printed on the operators console to
   announce the change to only be logged.  This control argument can
   only be used in the Initializer process.


Access required: This procedure requires access to metering_gate_ and
hphcs_, or to metering_gate_ and initializer_gate_ if -silent was
specified.


Notes: This procedure always prints the requested change and asks
for verification. This can be suppressed by using the answer command.
If the new value supplied is unacceptable to the hardcore for some
reason, an error message containing the explanation is printed.

See the Multics System Metering, Order No. AN52, for a complete list of
available tuning parameters.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
