Syntax:  aa paths {-alm_args} {-dp_args} {-control_args}


Function: submits an absentee request to perform ALM assemblies.


Arguments:
paths
   are the pathnames of segments to be assembled.
-alm_args
   are control arguments accepted by the alm command.
-dp_args
   are control arguments (except -delete) accepted by the dprint
   command.


Control arguments:
-queue N, -q N
   is the priority queue of the request.  The default queue is defined
   by the system administrator.  See "Notes" for a description of the
   interaction with the dprinting of listing files.
-hold
   does not dprint or delete any listing files.
-output_file path, -of path
   puts absentee output in a segment with a pathname of path.
-limit N, -li N
   specifies time limit in seconds for the absentee job.


Notes:
Control arguments and paths can be mixed freely and can appear anywhere
on the command line after the command.

Unpredictable results may occur if two absentee requests are submitted
that simultaneously attempt to compile the same segment or write into
the same absout segment.


If -queue is not specified, the request is submitted into the default
absentee priority queue defined by the site and, if requested, the
listing files is dprinted in the default queue of the request type
specified on the command line.  (If no request type is supplied, the
"printer" request type is used.)

If -queue is specified, the listing files are dprinted in the same
queue as is used for the absentee request.  If the request type
specified for dprinting does not have that queue, the highest numbered
queue available for the request type is used and a warning is issued.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
