02/20/85  reset_ips_mask

Syntax as a command:  reset_ips_mask {signal_names} {-control_args}


Function: sets the IPS mask for the current process to unmask some or
all IPS signals.


Arguments:
signal_names
   are the names of one or more IPS signals to be unmasked.  The signal
   names must be defined in sys_info$ips_mask_data.  Presently the
   defined signal names are quit, alrm, neti, cput, trm_, sus_, wkp_,
   pgt_, system_shutdown_scheduled_, and dm_shutdown_scheduled_.
   Supply either signal_names or -all.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   sets the IPS mask to unmask all IPS signals.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses printing of the previous state of the IPS mask after
   setting it.
-long, -lg
   prints the previous state of the IPS mask after setting it.
   (Default)


Notes: If all undefined IPS signals are either masked or unmasked and
you give -long, they are not mentioned; if, however, some are masked
and others are not, an octal list is printed.  This can only happen
when you specify an invalid (probably uninitialized) value in a call to
set that mask.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
