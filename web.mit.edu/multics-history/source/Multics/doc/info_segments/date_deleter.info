02/08/85  date_deleter

Syntax as a command:
   date_deleter dir_path cutoff {star_names} {-control_args}


Function: deletes segments and multisegment files (MSFs) older than a
specified number of days or older than a given date-time.


Arguments:
dir_path
   is the pathname of the directory in which the deletions are to
   occur; dir_path can be -working_directory (-wd) to indicate the
   working directory.
cutoff
   is a positive integer number of days.  If it is an integer N, files
   with a date more than N days old are deleted; if it is a date-time
   DT, files with a date earlier than DT are deleted.
   (See time_strings.gi.)
star_names
   are the optional starnames of files to be deleted.  If you supply
   none, all files older than the specified number of days are deleted;
   otherwise only files matching one or more of the starnames, and
   older than the specified number of days, are deleted.


Control arguments:
-absolute_pathname, -absp
   prints the entire pathname of the entries listed by -long,
   -query_all, and -query_each.  (Default: to print entrynames)
-all, -a, -branch, -br
   deletes directories, segments, and multisegment files.
-date_time_contents_modified, -dtcm
   uses the date/time value specified in the dtcm attribute to
   calculate the deletion date.  (Default)
-date_time_dumped, -dtd
   uses the dtd of each entry instead of the dtcm.
-date_time_entry_modified, -dtem
   uses the dtem of each entry instead of the dtcm.
-date_time_used, -dtu
   uses the dtu of each entry instead of the dtcm.


-directory, -dr
   deletes directories only.
-entryname, -etnm
   prints only the entrynames of the files listed by -long, -query_all,
   and -query_each rather than the entire pathname.  (Default)
-file, -f
   deletes segments and multisegment files.  (Default)
-long, -lg
   prints a message of the form "Deleted <type> <path>" for each entry
   deleted.
-multisegment_file, -msf
   multisegment files only.
-name STR, -nm STR
   specifies a starname STR that begins with a minus sign, to
   distinguish it from a control argument.


-query_all, -qya
   lists all entries to be deleted and queries whether they should be
   deleted or not.
-query_each, -qye
   queries for every entry to be deleted.
-segment, -sm
   deletes segments only.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
