07/09/90  delete_name, dn

Syntax as a command:  dn {paths} {-control_args}


Function: deletes specified name(s) from segments, multisegment files
(MSFs), links, directories, data management (DM) files, or extended
entries that have multiple names.


Arguments:
paths
   are the pathnames to be deleted.  This argument can be "-name STR"
   to specify a nonstandard name, such as one beginning with a minus
   sign or containing * or >.  The star convention is allowed, but does
   not apply to STR.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses error messages when entries are not found with specified
   pathnames.
-interpret_as_extended_entry, -inaee
   interpret the selected entry as an extended entry type.
-interpret_as_standard_entry, -inase
   interpret the selected entry as a standard entry type.
-long, -lg
   prints error messages when entries are not found.  (Default)


Access required: You need modify permission on the parent directory.


Notes: At least one path or -name STR must be specified.  The final
portion of the relative or absolute pathname is deleted from the
storage system entry it specifies, provided that doing so does not
leave the segment or directory without a name, in which case an error
message is printed.

See the add_name and rename commands.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
