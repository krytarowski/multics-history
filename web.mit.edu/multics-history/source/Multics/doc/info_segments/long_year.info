Syntax as a command:  long_year {time_string} {-control_arg}


Syntax as an active function:  [long_year {time_string} {-control_arg}]


Function: returns the four-digit number of a year in the clock from
0001 through 9999.  The format string to produce this is "^9999yc".


Arguments:
time_string
   indicates the date about which information is desired.  If you
   supply no time_string, the current date is used.  The time string is
   concatenated to form a single argument even if it contains spaces;
   you need not quote it.  (See time_strings.gi for a description of
   valid time_string values.)


Control arguments:
-zone STR
   STR specifies the zone that is to be used to express the result.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
