Syntax as a command:  pem code


Syntax as an active function:  [pem code]


Function: prints out the standard Multics (error_table_)
interpretation of a specified error code.  The various entries given
below allow you to specify the error code in either decimal or octal
and have the output come out in either the short or long error_table_
form.  The active function returns, as a single quoted string, what the
command prints.


Arguments:
code
   is the decimal integer to be interpreted.  The short form of the
   error message is printed.


Entry--pel
This entry is the same as pem except that the long form of the error
message is printed or returned as a single quoted string.

Syntax as a command--pel code

Syntax as an active function--[pel code]


Entry--peo
This entry is the same as pem except that the input code is assumed to
be octal.

Syntax as a command--peo octal_code

Syntax as an active function--[peo octal_code]


Entry--peol
This entry is the same as pel except that the input code is assumed to
be octal.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
