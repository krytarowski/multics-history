:Info: page.gi: 02/25/82 page

     A 1024 36-bit word block of data within a segment.


:Info: page_control.gi: 02/25/82 page control

     The routines that manage the transfer of pages between secondary
storage and main memory frames.


:Info: parent_directory.gi: 02/25/82 parent directory

     A parent directory is one that is immediately above, or superior,
to another directory.


:Info: password.gi: 02/25/82 password

     A character string that enables an individual user to enter the
system; it is known only to that user and the program that controls
access to the system.  When supplied with the user's Person_id at
log-in time, it validates the true identity of the user.

The password is a string of one to eight characters.  The characters
may be any printing character from the ASCII character set except
space and semi-colon.  The backspace character is also allowed, and is
counted as a character.  The password used for interactive logins may
not be "quit", "help", "HELP", or "?", because these have special
meaning to the password processor.


:Info: person_name_table.gi: PNT.gi: pnt.gi:
02/25/82 person name table (PNT)

     System table containing all Person_ids (persons and fictitious
persons) registered on Multics with their encoded password, default
project, address, and certain other data.


:Info: Person_id.gi: person_id.gi: 02/25/82 Person_id

     A unique name assigned to each user of the system.  It is usually
some form of the user's name and contains both uppercase and lowercase
characters.  It may not contain blank characters.  Associated with the
Person_id is a single password.  The Person_id and the password can be
used to identify a person on several projects.


:Info: physical_volume.gi: 02/25/82 physical volume

     A disk pack.  Sometimes the combination of pack and disk drive is
referred to as the physical volume.


:Info: pointer.gi: 02/25/82 pointer

     An address value.  On Multics, an address consists basically of a
segment number and an offset within the segment.


:Info: primary_name.gi: 02/25/82 primary name

     The main name associated with a segment, directory, multisegment
file, or link.


:Info: process.gi: 02/25/82 process

     The activities (programs, data entry, etc.) of an individual user
that begin when the user logs in, including absentee log in, and
continue until logout or until another process is explicitly begun
through use of the new_proc command.


:Info: process_directory.gi: 02/25/82 process directory

     A directory containing those segments that are meaningful only
during the life of a process.  These segments include the stack(s),
free storage, PIT, and various temporary segments.


:Info: pit.gi: PIT.gi: 02/25/82 pit (process-initialization table)

     The segment (in the process directory) that contains information
about process initialization, i.e., Person_id and Project_id, home
directory, attributes, and accounting data.


:Info: process_overseer.gi: 02/01/84 process overseer

     A procedure called during process initialization that sets up the
environment.  It then returns to its caller (initialize_process_),
which calls the listener to start reading commands.  For more
information, see process_overseer_.info.


:Info: project.gi: 02/25/82 project

     An arbitrary set of users grouped together for accounting and
access control purposes.


:Info: project_administrator.gi: 02/25/82 project administrator

     A person who has the access to specify spending limits and other
attributes for the users on a particular project.


:Info: project_definition_table.gi: PDT.gi: pdt.gi: 02/25/82 PDT

     An administrative data base that defines all people authorized to
use an account.


:Info: project_master_file.gi: PMF.gi: pmf.gi:
02/25/82 project master file (PMF)

     An ASCII file giving the names, attributes, and account limits of
the users on a particular project.  It is compiled into a project
definition table.


:Info: Project_id.gi: project_id.gi: 02/25/82 Project_id

     The name assigned to a project.


:Info: pure_procedure.gi: 02/26/82 pure procedure

     A procedure that does not modify itself.


:Info: quit_request.gi: 02/26/82 quit request

     Several commands that read input from the keyboard use the typed
request "quit" or "q" to indicate to them that the user is done.  This
is NOT the same as issuing the quit signal.  (See quit_signal.info)


:Info: quit_signal.gi: 02/26/82 quit signal

     A method used to interrupt a running program.  The quit condition
is raised by pressing the key on a terminal, such as ATTN, BRK,
INTERRUPT.  This condition normally causes the printing of QUIT
followed by establishment of a new command level.


:Info: quota.gi: 03/05/82 quota

     The maximum number of pages that can be used in a hierarchy of
directories.  Each user is allotted a predetermined amount of quota;
however, quota can be increased by a system administrator.


:Info: quote.gi: 02/26/82 quote

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
