                                     INTRODUCTION




          Multics Release  11.0 (MR11.0) is a complete  release and assumes
          the prior installation of MR10.2.  That is, the library tapes are
          self-supporting and  do not require any other  information to run
          Multics.


          This document  includes descriptions of features  included in the
          current Multics Release, MR11.0.


          A  separate document,  Software Installation  Bulletin (SIB),  is
          supplied with  the release tapes.  The  Installation Instructions
          describe the contents of the release tapes and include procedures
          for installation of MR11.0.


          Additional  documentation  is  provided  with  the release tapes,
          either as printable segments on  the tape (in a special directory
          >doc>MR11.0), or as paper copy.


          Following  is a  summary of   the remainder  of sections  in this
          document.

                capabilities.




          Highlights                     2-1                          SRB11


           ox    The  numerous security   enhancements provide  the baseline
                submitted to the U.  S.   Government for evaluation as a B2
                secure  computing   facility.   This  evaluation   will  be
                performed after the General Release of MR11.0.  See Section
                3 for details.

           ox    Dynamic reconfigurartion  of IOMs and attached  channels is
                provided.

           ox    An  improved  and  adaptive  disk  device  interface module
                provides increased optimization and reduces I/O bottlenecks
                to the disk subsystems.

           ox    An improved  operator environment with an  ssu_ facility as
                well as operator login/logout is now available.

           ox    The Answering  Service was extensively modified  to support
                various  security  and  auditing  changes  to the operating
                system.  See Section 3 for details.

           ox    The  Volume  Backup  System   was  enhanced  to  allow  the
                reloading of 'strange' physical volumes.

           ox    The  analyze_multics command  tool was  enhanced to provide
                the capability of analyzing dead processes.  A tool to copy
                saved dead processes is also provided.


          _C_O_M_M_U_N_I_C_A_T_I_O_N_S


           ox    In   support   of   the   security   features   in  MR11.0,
                communications channels now have AIM ranges associated with
                them.  These ranges are set by the security administrator.

           ox    The  Multics Communication  System now  supports a hardware
                output  flow  control  protocol  on  hardwired asynchronous
                communications lines.

          Highlights                     2-2                          SRB11


           ox    Data Management - see Appendix D

           ox    Reconnection  to  disconnected  processes  under  the Video
                System   was   improved   by   the   implementation   of  a
                "reconnection"  control  order.    Reconnection  no  longer
                causes a fatal process error.

           ox    MR11 permits a common segment and directory operations (ACL
                manipulation, name management etc.)   to be applied to more
                complex  object  types,  using  the  standard  file  system
                commands.  These are termed  "extended types".  See Section
                3 for details.

           ox    The date/time  software was changed to  provide several new
                features.   Users may  now specify  the language  (English,
                French,   German,   or   Spanish)   to   specify  date/time
                specifiers.  See Section 3 for details.

           ox    The  Message  Facility  was   enhanced  to  accept  mailbox
                specification and now uses the Mail Table.

           ox    The  new mtape_  tape I/O  module was  installed.  This I/O
                module supports I/O to ANSI  and IBM Standard tape formats.
                The tape_archive command was upgraded to use mtape_.

           ox    Support was added for XMODEM and IBM PC to PC file transfer
                protocols.  Additionally,  the Kermit file  server protocol
                is available as a Priced Software Product.


          _P_R_I_C_E_D _S_O_F_T_W_A_R_E _P_R_O_D_U_C_T_S


           ox    A Kermit file server protocol is now available.

           ox    FORTRAN now supports the  use of Hexadecimal Floating Point
                numbers.  Real,  complex, and double precision  numbers can
                now have four times the magnitude as previously available.

           ox    The BASIC implementation was  upgraded to provide increased
                compatibility with other BASIC versions.  See Section 3 for
                details.

           ox    The   LINUS  report   writer  was   reimplemented  as   the
                report_writer_ standard user subroutine.

           ox    Version 2 forums are now  available with the Forum Product.
                This implementation alleviates many restrictions imposed by
                Version 1  forums in the  area of participation  levels and
                the  size of  the proceedings.   Additionally, support  for
                forums as extended entry types is provided.




          Highlights                     2-3                          SRB11


           ox    The  Executive Forum  facility (xforum)  is now  available.
                This product provides a menu  driven interface to the Forum
                facility.

           ox    The   Executive   Mail   facility   (xmail)   now  provides
                personalization  options.   These  options  include  editor
                features,  built-in  help  facilities,  support  for  blind
                carbon  copies, and  other extensions.   See Section  3 for
                details.

          A- 1. [MCR  NNN+1]..  Provides  the  ability  of site maintenance
                personnel  to set  breakpoints  in  hardcore using  the BCE
                probe command.  When a  breakpoint is encountered, Bootload
                Multics  is  invoked  to  allow  the  analysis  of  machine
                conditions.  The breakpoint conditions  may be modified and
                Multics restarted.

          A- 2. [MCR  7072].. Removed  the ability   to run  without a  LOG
                partition.  Additionally, the LOG  partition MUST be on the
                RPV; it may  no longer be placed on the  other RLV volumes.
                It  is  not  necessary  to  rebuild  the  RPV  to add a LOG
                partition to  it.  Booting MR11.0  the first time  does it.
                However,  the  site  would   have  to  rebuild  the  volume
                containing the  old LOG partition if they  wished to regain
                the space.

                The LOG partition may be between 3 and 513 records in size;
                a  standard size of  255 records is  recommended.  Auditing
                sites will require larger logs.

          A- 3. [MCR 6924].. Converted to V2ec and generally modernized the
                acct_start_up.ec.

          A- 4. [MCR   6730   --    approved   and   installed]..   Changed
                delete_old_pdds to salvage old  process and sl1 directories
                before deleting  them to avoid online  salvager messages on
                the console.  The process running delete_old_pdds must have
                access  to the  soos privilege  in order  to be  allowed to
                salvage  out-of-service dirs.   It is  recommended that the
                delete_old_pdds command be run in  a process with access to
                the system_privilege_ gate.

          _B_C_E


          B- 1. [MCR NNNN]..  This release contains the  first installation
                of  Bootload Multics,  also known  as the  Bootload Command
                Environment  (BCE).  Bootload  Multics  is  a new  phase of
                Multics initialization.  It allows the operation of Multics
                with or without BOS.  The  ability to "warm" boot from disk
                is provided  by Bootload Multics; that is,  to boot without
                the  MST mounted  on a  tape drive.   Refer to  the Multics
                System Maintenance  Procedures, Order AM81 (Section  6) and
                the  Multics Admin,  Maint, and  Operations Commands, Order
                No.  GB64 (Section 9) for detail.

                Bootload  Multics provides  a new  ring zero  command level
                which  is used  to perform  the functions  of warm booting,
                dumping  and  examining  memory,  and  emergency  shutdown.
                These functions can no longer be performed from BOS.  Also,
                automatic  booting of Multics  is driven from  the Bootload
                Multics command  level.  The BOS functions  of SAVE/RESTOR,
                SAVE COPY,  CORE SAVE/RESTOR, as well as  a few specialized
                functions,  are  not  yet  available  and  continue  to  be
                provided under  BOS.  Additionally, printer support  is not
                yet available.

                The  operation  of  Bootload  Multics  is  described in the
                Multics System  Maintenance Procedures, Order  Number AM81.
                This material  must be read  prior to attempting  a boot of
                this  release.  The  presence  of  Bootload Multics  has no
                effect on any user's process or application.

                Bootload Multics  requires 2455 pages of disk  space on the
                RPV  for its  operation, split  between the  new "bce"  and
                "file"  partitions.   These  partitions  are  automatically
                created  when this  release is  booted for  the first time;
                however,  site  personnel  must  assure  that  a sufficient
                amount  of space  exists in  the paging  region of  the rpv
                prior to first booting BCE.

                Refer  to Appendix  A of  the MR11.0  Software Installation
                Bulletin for additional discussion  of the changes involved
                with Bootload Multics.

          B- 2. [MCR 6887]..  Added the session_type keyword  to the system
                command/active  function to  allow  a  site control  of the
                actions  of  system  startup  dependant  upon  the  type of
                session of Multics service.  For  example, if it is desired
                to suppress the  login of certain daemons then  all that is
                necessary is to change the system_start_up.ec as follows:

                   &if  [equal [system  session_type] special]  &then &goto
                   no_daemons
                   sc_command login IO SysDaemon cord
                   sc_command login Utility SysDaemon ut
                   .
                   .  &label no_daemons


          _S_y_s_t_e_m _O_p_e_r_a_t_i_o_n


          C- 1. [MCR  6917].. Allow  the directory  lock writebehind (DIRW)
                parameter to  be changed while  Multics is in  operation by
                using the change_tuning_parameters command.


          C- 2. Disk subsystem I/O is improved  with the installation of an
                adaptive  disk.. device  interface module.   Sites can tune
                the size  of the frequence  and allocate up  to 64 channels
                per subsystem.  Additionally, adaptive optimization permits
                high peak  loading before system saturation.   This feature
                is tunable to permit site specific variation.

          C- 3. [Hardcore 5 --- MSS 41-8].. MR11.0 supports the C.0 version
                of  console firmware  for the  CSU6601 (LCC)  device.  This
                firmware   provides  increased   reliability  as   well  as
                enhancements  which allow  reading passwords  without being

          C- 4. [MCR  7082].. If  LCC consoles   are used  without the  C.0
                firmware revision,  then the "MASK" field in  the PRPH OPCn
                card is required.  This new  keyword actually tells the I/O
                module,  ocd_,  that  the  specified  console  is unable to
                suppress     echoing.     The     I/O    module     returns
                error_table_$undefined_order_request    in   response    to
                printer_off control  orders for that console.   This causes
                the read_password_  subroutine to print the  mask.  Failure
                to provide this  keyword may result in attempts  to send an
                unsupported  DCW to the  console channel adapter.   This in
                turn causes console recovery to come into play and the site
                may find itself with all  I/O being forwarded to the syserr
                log or  Message Coordinator, or  in the case  that the CCRF
                parm is specified, the system may crash.

                The format of the new card is as follows:

                PRPH  OPC<tag>  <IOM>  <CHNL>  <MODEL>  <LINE_LENG> <STATE>
                {MASK}

                The MASK  field for EMC  style consoles is  a no-op.  These
                consoles are always set to mask the password, regardless of
                the state of the MASK field on the card.

                EMCs  that have  a  CONRAC  monitor attached  (CSU6004) are
                unable to mask  the password on the monitor.   The same may
                be  said of  LCCs that   have a  monitor attached  and have
                firmware prior to the C.0 version.

          D- 1. [MCR  7043].. IOM  switches are  validated for  consistency
                when the  IOM is added  to the system.   Since the switches
                cannot  be  read  directly,   they  must  be  validated  by
                experimentally accessing the IOM.   If the switches are set
                incorrectly, the  experiment can damage  arbitrary sections
                of main  memory.  Therefore, all modified  memory pages are
                written out  to disk before performing  the experiment (the
                system  will crash  if  the  experiment fails).   Also, the
                system stops responding to users while the memory pages are
                being  written  out  and  while  the  experiment  is  being
                conducted  (about a  10  second  pause, depending  upon the
                number  of  modified  pages  in  memory).  This consistency
                check can be  bypassed by adding the DRIS  parameter to the
                PARM card in the config deck.

          D- 2. [MCR 6932]..  Effective with this release all  IOMs must be
                operated in  paged mode.  The operating mode  switch on the
                IOM must be set to "PAGED",  and the model field on all iom
                cards in  the config deck  must be "nsa".   This means that
                6000 IOMs  are no longer  supported because they  cannot be
                used in paged mode.

          I- 4. [MCR 7044]..  Changed the error codes returned  by the file
                system when an access violation is attempted.  The previous
                policy was to return error_table_$moderr ("Incorrect access
                on  entry")  or  error_table_$incorrect_access  ("Incorrect
                access to  directory containing entry") unless  the process
                lacked access to see the process' access, in which case the
                returned   code  was   error_table_$no_info  ("Insufficient
                access to return any  information").  Any attempt to access
                a non-existent object returned error_table_$noentry ("Entry
                not  found")  or  some  derivative.   This  policy is being
                superceded  by  a  more  restrictive  policy.   In  the new
                policy,   the   system   returns   error_table_$moderr   or
                error_table_$incorrect_access  only when the  process' have
                access  to see  existence of  the object  of the  attempted
                access.  A  process has access  to see the  existence of an
                object  if  the  process  possesses  nonnull  access to the
                object or to its parent  directory.  When the process lacks
                access  to see  the existence   of the  object, the  system
                returns  error_table_$no_info.    If  the  target   of  the
                attempted  access  does  not   exist,  the  system  returns
                error_table_$noentry  (or some   derivative) only  when the
                process   has  access   to  determine   the  non-existence;
                otherwise, the process  receives error_table_$no_info.  The
                most notable user visible change is for list/set IACL, move
                quota,  and  star_  listing.   For  these  operations,  the
                previous        behavior        was        to        return
                error_table_$incorrect_access   when  the   process  lacked
                access  (s or  m) on  the directory  in question.   The new
                returned error code is error_table_$moderr.

                This policy ("no access  to see existence implies no_info")
                is  applied  to  all  attempts  to  refer  to a file system
                object.   The  major  case  in  which  this  policy will be
                apparent  is  when  it  is  no  longer  possible  to add an
                arbitrary  directory to  the search  rules, or  to set  the
                working directory  to an arbitrary directory.   The process
                must  possess  access  to  determine  the  existence of the
                directory in question.

          J- 3. [MCR 7145]..  Changes have been  made to the  file system's
                handling of  directory quota to  close a covert  channel (a
                means  of  transmitting  information  in  violation  of AIM
                policies) and to make it a more useful storage measure.

                COVERT CHANNEL CHANGE

                The  file  system   prevents  processes  from  transmitting
                information   between   AIM-isolated   processes   via  the
                directory quota used values of upgraded directories.  If an
                upgraded  directory lacks  a terminal  directory quota, the
                system  includes  the  allocation  of  new  pages  in  that
                directory  amongst  the  events  controlled  by  the covert
                channel   bandwidth  limiter   (refer  to   Multics  System
                Administration Procedures, Order No.  AK50).  If the covert
                channel limiter is enabled,  any process that allocates new
                pages in such  a directory may be forced to  wait to insure
                that the  frequency of those page  creations, together with
                other potential covert channel  events, does not exceed the
                defined limit.

                If the  upgraded directory has a  terminal directory quota,
                then  no covert  channel is  available, and  no waiting  is
                forced.

                We  recommend that  upgraded directories  be given terminal
                directory  quota.    The  create_dir  command   provides  a
                -dir_quota  control  argument  for  supplying  a  value for
                directory quota.  The system automatically supplies a value
                for   directory  quota   for  system   generated,  upgraded
                directories.   For  process   directories,  this  value  is
                default_pdir_dir_quota in installation parms.

                CHANGE IN THE DEFINITION OF DIR QUOTA

                In previous releases, the pages of a directory were charged
                against the directory quota of  its parent.  In MR11.0, the
                pages  of a  directory  are  charged against  the directory
                itself.   For example,  if a  project is  given a  terminal
                directory  quota to  change for  dir pages  used, the pages
                used  by  the  project  directory  are  now  charged to the
                project rather than to system overhead.

                DIR QUOTA IS STILL NOT ENFORCED

                Note  that   Multics  does  not  enforce   directory  quota
                checking.   However,  directory   quota  checking  will  be
                enabled  in a  future release.   Thus it  is recommended to
                establish valid  values for directory quota  throughout the
                hierarchy.   See  the  Software  Installation  Bulletin for
                instructions.

          J- 4. [MCR  7038].. Changed the  create_dir command to  allow the
                volume  administrator to  explicitly specify  the owner and
                quota account for a master directory.

          J- 5. [MCR 7038]..  Changed the new_proj command to  prompt for a
                master directory  owner and quota account  when the project
                directory is to be a  master directory.  The meaning of the
                flags  is radically changed.   Refer to the  Multics System

                detail.

          J- 6. [MCR  7107]..  Changed  the  format  of  the per-person and

                poll_mpc puts into the syserr log was advanced from 1 to 2.
                The new  entries are MPC type specific,  thus saving unused
                space.   The  mpc_data_summary  command  processes  the new
                version entries and skips version 1 messages with a warning
                message.

                The  load_mpc   command  informs  the  Operator,   via  the
                Initializer  console, about  the activity  of the  command.
                This includes suspending IO, running ITRs, loading firmware
                (tells  what  revision),  and  resuming  IO  (or leaving IO
                suspended).  This  requires access to the  phcs_ gate.  The
                command does not run if the access is incorrect.

          J- 8. [MCR  7006].. Deleted  the print_dump_tape  command.  Sites
                should de-register Print_Dump.Daemon.

          J- 9. [MSS  41-7].. Changes made  to the PNT  are audited in  the
                Syserr Log.   Entries in the log contain  binary data which
                provides detailed information about  the PNT change and can
                be displayed with the "print_sys_log -expand" command.  The
                text portion of these messages provides a brief description
                of the PNT changes.

                If a user's PNT authorization range is changed, in a manner
                incompatible with  the authorizaton of the  logged in user,
                the user is bumped with no  grace period.  The user is also
                bumped if the PNT entry is deleted.

                The  Answering  Service  Identification  and Authentication
                (I&A)  log  entries  (LOGIN,  LOGOUT,  CONNECT, DISCONNECT,
                etc.)   have changed  syntax and  contain binary  data with
                security relevant information.  The site should familiarize
                itself with the new entries  and ensure that the operations
                staff is aware of the  new log entries.  The "print_sys_log
                -expand" command  displays the binary data  associated with
                these log entries.

                The most notable changes to I&A log messages are:

                1)  LOGIN/LOGOUT  messages  refer  to  the  time  a user is
                identified by  name and authenticated by  password.  At the
                time  a communications  channel is  authenticated, a  LOGIN
                audit message is placed in the Answering Service log.  When
                the  terminal  is  considered  no  longer  authenticated, a
                LOGOUT message is placed in the log.

                2)  When a  user creates   a process,  destroys a  process,
                connects to a process, disconnects  from a process, etc.  a
                CREATE, DESTROY,  CONNECT, or DISCONNECT message  is placed
                in the log.  If a user  issues the dial or slave pre-access
                command, an audit message is placed  in the log of the form
                DIAL or SLAVE.

                Replaced  the  daily_log_process  and  daily_syserr_process
                commands with the summarize_sys_log command.  These changes
                are  described elsewhere.   The Honeywell-supplied  control
                files  for  these  commands   include  the  new  I&A  audit
                messages.  Sites  should check over these  control files to
                ensure they are getting what they expect.

          J-10. If  the validate_daemon_commands installation  parameter is
                enabled,  the..  system  will  require  an  MC  ACS segment
                corresponding to  any message coordinator  "source_id" used
                in reference to the use  of system daemon processes.  These
                MC ACS segments reside in the directoy >sc1>mc_acs and take
                the form  <source_id>,mcacs, (e.g., prta.mcacs).   These MC
                ACS  segments  are  extended  entries  (see  the discussion
                elsewhere in this SRB) and  have the allowable ACL modes of
                "c", "d", "q", and "r".  These have the following meaning:

                   c -- specified  processes  may  control  login/logout of
                        daemons over this message coordinator source_id.
                   d -- specified  processes  may  be  logged  in over this
                        source_id.
                   q -- specified  processes   may  cause  a  QUIT   to  be
                        signalled  to  the  daemon   logged  in  over  this
                        source_id.
                   r -- specified processes may  send "replies" (or command
                        lines) to the daemon logged in over this source_id.

                   See the discussion in  the Multics System Administrative
                   Procedures, Order No.  AK50 for further information.

          J-11. A  new  command,  send_daemon_command,  allows sufficiently
                privileged..  processes  to  control  system  daemons.  The
                command allows the login and logout of daemons, the sending
                of QUIT  signals to daemons,  and the sending  of arbitrary
                input  lines to  daemons.  If  the validate_daemon_commands
                installation parameter  is disabled, then rw  access to the
                ACS   segment   >sc1>admin_acs>send_daemon_command.acs   is
                required to  use this command.   In this mode,  there is no
                ability to restrict access to  a particular set of daemons.
                If  the validate_daemon_commands installation  parameter is
                enabled, the MC ACS segments  control access to the daemons
                as described above.


          J-12. The send_admin_command capability was completely re-written
                for.. MR11.0.  The segment >sc1>communications was deleted,
                and         instead,         the         ACS        segment
                >sc1>admin_acs>send_admin_commands.acs  controls access  to
                this facility.   The output of  send_admin_command commands
                is logged in the admin log (>sc1>as_logs>admin_log) and may
                optionally  be   returned  to  the  user   via  mail.   The
                successful completion  of a send_admin_command  command can
                be determined as  well.  It is no longer  possible to "hang
                up" the Initializer process by sending a command which asks
                a    question.     See    the    documentation    on    the
                send_admin_command    in   the    Multics   Administrative,
                Maintenance,  and Operation  Commands, Order  No.  GB64 for
                details.

          J-13. A  very security-conscious  site may  wish to  disallow the
                ability to.. change process  authorization with a "new_proc
                -auth  AUTHORIZATION"  command  without  first  providing a
                "trusted path"  with the supervisor.  Further,  it may wish
                to  disallow  a  "logout  -hd"/"login"  sequence  without a
                trusted  path.   The  only  trusted-path  Multics provides,
                currently, is the loss of  DTR and subsequent hangup.  When
                the  line  dials  up  again,  it  can  be assured of direct
                communication with  the supervisor (Answering  Service) and
                thus  be assured  that it  is not  being spoofed.   See the
                discussion   in   the    "Multics   System   Administrative
                Procedures, Order No.  AK50 on "Trusted Path" for important
                details.

          J-14. When a  logged-in user's authorization in the  PNT, PDT, or
                SAT;.. or  the user's channel  authorization in the  CDT is
                changed by  an administrator in such  a way as to  make the
                currently  logged in  instance of  the user's authorization
                incompatible  with the new  authorization, the user  is now
                bumped with no grace period.  Both raising a user's minimum
                authorization  or lowering  a user's  maximum authorization
                may cause bumping.

          J-15. [MCR  6957].. Installed  five  gates  in >tools.   The gate
                names,  brief  description,  and  recommended  access  are:
                pnt_login_gate_,  identification  and  authentication  upon
                login,     re    access     for    Initializer.SysDaemon.z;
                pnt_admin_gate_, users allowed to read or write PNT entries
                require  access  to  this  gate  and  no  passwords  can be
                retrieved  using  entries  in  this  gate,  re  access  for
                Initializer.SysDaemon.z   and  re  access   to  *.SysAdmin;
                pnt_network_gate_, for Inter-Multics  File Transfer (IMFT),
                Card_Input,  and  IO.SysDaemon   manipulations  of  network
                (formerly card-input) passwords,  user_ids which manipulate
                and validate network passwords,  including IMFT daemons and
                daemons  which manipulate  card input,  require re  access;
                pnt_priv_gate_, not  currently in use but  allows access to
                passwords and is available for very privileged applications
                which  must  perform  statistical  analysis  of  passwords,
                access to this gate should be provided only when absolutely
                necessary  to the  most trusted  of system  administrators;
                pnt_fs_gate_, allows nonprivileged users to list the ACL on
                the  PNT so as  not to cause  faults when using  the "list"
                command   and  other  ACL   commands.   re  *.*.*   ACL  is
                recommended.

                When bringing up  MR11.0 for the first time,  the PNT, URF,
                and  MAIL_TABLE  must  be   converted.   See  the  Software
                Installation  Bulletin (SIB)  associated with  this release
                for details.

          J-16. [MCR 7189].. Implemented a  Limited Service Subsystem (LSS)
                for  the  hierarchy  dumping  daemons.   Sites  wishing  to
                operate  their  system  in  conformance  with  the  DoD  B2
                criteria  must  follow  the   procedures  in  the  SysAdmin
                Procedures  manual to  insure  that  Backup and  Dumper run
                within the appropriate Limited Service Subsystem.

          J-17. [MCR 7037].. Implemented a  Limited Service Subsystem (LSS)
                for  the Volume  Backup System  as part  of the  B2 effort.
                This  system includes Volume_Dumper,  Volume_Retriever, and
                Volume_Reloader.

                The supplied start_up.ecs provided with this release invoke
                the  enter_lss  command  with  the  appropriate  table name
                (e.g.,      volume_dumper,       volume_retriever,      and
                volume_reloader).  The installation instructions advise the
                site  that Volume  Backup can   be run  without the  LSS by
                removing  the  appropriate  command  line.   These  command
                tables are free-standing modules in >tools.

          J-18. [MCR NONE].. Changed the default  acl to the r1_io_ gate to
                null to *.  This is  because there was an inherent security
                flaw  in the  design of  the cross_ring_io_,  such that  it
                could not be used to allow a non-trusted outer ring process
                to do I/O in the inner  ring.  We recommend against ANY use
                of cross_ring_io_.  If you  have existing applications, you
                should convert them to having a special purpose gate.

          J-19. [MCR  7177].. The  convert_old_log command  is available to
                convert  old message  coordinator logs  to logs  of the new
                format in MR11.  This will enable the print_sys_log command
                to  display information  that was  logged before installing
                MR11.   Not  all  message   coordinator  logs  need  to  be
                converted at  installation time.  However, the  logs should
                be converted before the first crank run.

          J-20. [MCR  6957].. Moved  the PNT  to ring  1 and  added the pnt
                suffix to the PNT in >system_control_1.  Safe copies of the
                pnt can be made by using the copy command which understands
                the ring-1 pnt extended objects.

          J-21. [MCR   6957]..  Changed   the  calling   sequence  of   the
                undocumented   pnt_manager_    internal   interface.    All
                site-written  utilities  calling   pnt_manager_  should  be
                examined and modified as necessary.

          J-22. [MCR  7168].. RCPRM  will no  longer allow  resources to be
                reclaimed after  release but before being  degaussed by the
                librarian.  Rather, the user will be queried when releasing
                the resource instead.

          J-23. [MCR  6935]..  Removed  the  volume  registration  commands
                add_vol_registration,              change_vol_registration,
                list_vol_registration,  and  del_vol_registration  from the
                operator  interface.   There  function  is  replaced by the
                administrative   commands  add_volume_registration   (avr),
                change_volume_registration  (cvr), list_volume_registration
                (lvr), and delete_volume_registration (dvr).

                A  user's access  to a  private logical  volume is computed
                using the ACS pathname contained in the volume registration
                data bases.  Previous releases  used links in the directory
                >lv.  Site  personnel should verify that  the ACS pathnames
                in the registration data bases  are up-to-date (use the lvr
                command to inspect and the cvr command to adjust).  The ACS
                links in >lv can be removed.

                The registration data bases for the root logical volume are
                moved  from  >lv.root  and  >root.mdcs  to  >lv>lv.root and
                >lv>root.mdcs respectively.   (>lv is where the  data bases
                for all other logical volumes reside.)

          J-24. [MCR  6965].. Incompatably  changed the  use_totals segment
                format for MR11.  The command cv_MR10_2_use_totals converts
                an old  .use_totals segment to  the new format.   A copy of
                the  segment should  be saved   for use  if MR11.0  must be
                backed-out.   Alternately,  since  only  the  crank changes
                segments, you can avoid running a crank on MR11.0 until you
                are sure that you do not want to back out the release.  The
                new format allows for billing cycles  of up to 190 days, as
                opposed to the old 40 day limit.

          J-25. [MCR 7012].. Renamed the directory >sc1>proxy to admin_acs.
                All   acs    segments   from   >sc1,   and    the   segment
                >sc1>rcp>tandd.acs   must  be    moved  to   the  admin_acs
                directory.

          J-26. [MCR 7072].. Reformatted the syserr log.  It is stored in a
                different format, and in a different directory.  Because of
                these  changes, in  order to  preserve the  history in  the
                existing  syserr  log,  it  must  be  converted  to the new
                format.

                The  syserr   log  can  now   be  printed  using   the  new
                print_sys_log  command, and  the summarize_sys_log  command
                replaces  the daily_syserr_process.   Changed the  hardware
                error reporting commands and HEALS,  which scan the log, to
                accommodate the new format and subroutine interfaces.

          K- 1. [MCR 7157]..  Added access control for  message coordinator
                sources as  an option feature  of the system.   By enabling
                the  validate_daemon_commands installation_parm,  sites can
                force daemons logging in,  and operators and administrators
                controlling daemons to have  access to special acs segments
                for daemon sources.  The new acs segments are stored in the
                new >sc1>mc_acs directory.

          K- 2. [MCR  7107]..  Enhanced  ed_installation_parms  to  include
                three security auditing thresholds which control the volume
                of syserr  messages for those sites  using access auditing.
                See the command description in "MAM - System".

          K- 3. [MCR 7062]..  Now when a login is  attempted (successful or
                otherwise), and  other instances of a  personid are already
                logged in, these latter processes are notified of the login
                attempt regardless of whether or not the project-ids match.
                With previous releases, only  exact matches of Personid and
                Projectid  provoked  the   notification.   Additionally,  a
                logging-in user is informed of other login instances of the
                same  Personid  regardless  of  whether  the -brief control
                argument was used.

          K- 4. [MCR 7027].. Added a request  type to the Answering Service
                Request mechanism that  enables privileged system processes
                to  logout  other  users.    Access  to  this  function  is
                controlled by an ACS segment.  This is strictly an internal
                interface, access should not be granted to other users.

          K- 5. [MCR 7061]..  Discontinued support to suppress  the message
                "Your  password  was  given  incorrectly  N times recently.
                Last bad password PASSWORD from ASCII terminal "ID"."  upon
                login  by using  the -brief  control argument  to the login
                command.

                the reconfiguration user  commands with the reconfiguration

          L- 2. [MCR 6740].. Extended the Volume Backup System to allow the
                reloading of  "stranger" physical volumes.   This extension
                is  only useable  with version   2 Volume  Logs, which  are
                created  by  the  Volume  Dumper  in  this  release.   This
                capability obviates  the need to reload  the RPV separately
                from other  physical volumes, as  well as providing  a site
                with multiple  systems, the ability to perform  a reload of
                one system's volumes on  another system.  It is recommended
                that a complete_volume_dump be performed after installation
                of this release to upgrade the volume logs.

          L- 3. [MCR  6957]..  Changed  structure  and  version  number  of
                Multi-Segment Tables (MSTB).  Version 3 is the only version
                supported.   All  Honeywell-provided  system administrative
                software  is  modified  to  support  version  3 MSTBs.  Any
                site-written software will have  to be upgraded.  MSTBs are
                an undocumented  internal interface, so this  change should
                not effect sites.

          L- 4. [MCR 6649  -- approved and installed]..  Changed the ring-1
                salvage_dirs command to only salvage the hierarchy to depth
                2, which are those  directories immediately below the root.
                These   are  the   only  directories   needed  for   system
                initialization.   This  restores   the  level  2  hierarchy
                salvaging of  BOOT RLVS and makes the  manual invocation of
                salvage_dirs much faster.

                The default salvage operation always includes the following
                salvaging      options:        -rebuild,      -check_vtoce,
                -delete_connect_failure,   plus   automatic   resetting  of
                out-of-service switches on  directories.  These options are
                deemed  optimal for  correcting problems  in the  hierarchy
                which might prevent successful bootloads.  For this reason,
                salvage_dirs  no  longer  accepts  any  control  arguments.
                Control arguments, if given, are ignored.

                Changed salvage_dirs to ensure  that quota used is computed
                correctly for these directories, and that >sc1 and the root
                directory  have sufficient  quota  to  allow the  system to
                boot.

          L- 5. [MCR  6412]..  Merged  the  source  and  object found under
                >library_dir_dir>system_library_languages      into     the
                >library_dir_dir>system_library_standard         directory.
                Retained  the names  from  the  old >ldd>lang  on >ldd>sss.
                Removed support  for the obsolete NCP  network software and
                deleted  the  libraries   >system_library_network  and  the
                coresponding   >ldd>system_library_network  subdirectories.
                Sites with  >system_library_network in their  system search
                rules should remove it.

          L- 6. [MCR 6778].. Added  the check_file_system_damage command to
                search  for  damaged  switches  set  on  segments  and  MSF
                components.  A  subroutine interface is also  provided.  It
                may be used on complete hierarchies.

          M- 1. [MCR 7007].. Direct channels connected  to FNPs are now run
                in paged mode.  This requires  a current rev NSAJM or NSBJM
                (direct  channel board)  in the  IOM.  The  645JM board  is
                de-supported along with unpaged IOMs.  The IOM must contain
                an NSDIA board, not an NSAIA or earlier version.

          M- 2. [MCR  6869]..  Changed  the  Multics  Communications System
                (Multics  CS) to  support  a  hardware output  flow control
                protocol  on hardwired  asynchronous communications  lines.
                This  protocol permits  the use  of DTEs  (e.g., terminals,
                printers, and statistical multiplexers) which can utilize a
                hardware flow  control.  These devices can  be supported by
                MCS  with no FNP  or MCS mainframe  loading in output  flow
                control or delay padding calculations or buffer space.

                The use  of a hardware protocol permits  sensing of printer
                conditions  which take the  printer off-line from  the data
                stream, preventing  correct functioning of a  software data
                imbedded  flow control  protocol,  but  which can  signal a
                hardware  status condition  through dropping  of a  dataset
                lead.

                The hardware protocol is  signalled through the CTS dataset
                lead of the  FNP asynch RS-232 connector.  If  this lead is
                high, data is transmitted to the DTE, if the lead drops low
                the current character is  completed and transmission ceases
                until the lead is raised.

                All normal dataset  leads (e.g., CD, CTS, and  DSR) must be
                high for a line to initially be considered on-line.

          N- 1. MR11.. The CDT  was changed to version 5.   It now supports
                access class ranges for  communication channels and the new
                check_acs flags.  Note that  the MR10.2 check_acs attribute
                was  changed  to   a  set  of  flags  and   a  new  keyword
                "check_acs:"  or  "Check_acs:"  understood  by  the  cv_cmf
                command.  The CDT is converted automatically the first time
                the MR11.0 Answering Service is initialized.

          O- 1. [MCR 7049].. Added the breakall_idle_timer parameter to the
                additional_info field in the TTF for X25 multiplexers.  The
                value is specified in twentieths  of a second.  The default
                is  2  (1/10  second).   This  value  is  used  to  set PAD
                parameter 4 (idle timer) when a user enters breakall mode.

          P- 1. [MCR  6813]..  Removed  lsla_man.map355  from  MCS  library
                because only DN6670s are supported by the mcs library.

          P- 2. [MCR   6748   --    approved   and   installed]..   Changed
                tty_replace_canon  to no  longer discard  invisible control
                characters when ctl_char mode is on.  This allows a control
                character  to share  a column  position with  a graphic, or
                other   control  character,   and  cannot   be  erased   by
                overstriking when can_type=replace mode is in effect.

          R- 1. [MCR 6962].. Changed several modules to utilize per-process
                time  defaults  (i.e.,  language,  zone,  date format, time
                format, and date_time format).






          Contents of MR11.0             3-19                         SRB11


          R- 2. [MCR  6834].. Incompatibly   changed date/time  software by
                making  time_table_ and  time_data_ obsolete  and replacing
                them with  time_info_ which contains names  of days, zones,
                etc.   in  four  languages.   Sites  may  add  zones and/or
                languages to this table if  needed.  Users are not intended
                to  directly  reference  these  names,  but  that  the user
                request the  needed information via an  appropriate call to
                the  date/time  system.   In  this  way,  language and zone
                defaults  are   taken  care  of  without   the  user  being
                concerned.   The  MR11.0  release  has  all  references  to
                time_table_$zones removed from system software.  Support of
                time_table_  will  be  discontinued  in  the  next release.
                Users must learn to use the new facilities by that time.

          R- 3. [MCR  6834].. Incompatibly   changed date/time  software to
                require the user to specify  time zones known to time_info_
                and to no longer allow an offset to be given which does not
                match  the  offset  contained  in  time_info_.   The module
                set_time_zone is  obsolete and will be deleted  in the next
                release.  Replaced set_time_zone by set_time_default.

          R- 4. [MCR 6834].. Installed a  new version of date/time software
                to  provide  several  new  features.   All date/time active
                functions which return words,  support the English, French,
                German,  and  Spanish  language.   Users  may  specify  the
                language  to  be  returned   by  using  the  -lang  control
                argument.

          R- 5. [MCR  6834]..  Changed  convert_date_to_binary_  to  accept
                monthnames, daynames, and zonenames in the English, French,
                German, and  Spanish language.  Languages may  not be mixed
                within a date/time string.  Changed convert_date_to_binary_
                to accept microseconds as an offset.

          R- 6. [MCR 6834]..  Changed date/time commands to  accept a -zone
                control argument  to specify the time zone  in which output
                is to be  expressed.  Time zones from around  the world are
                now available.  The set_time_zero command is now obsolete.

          T- 1. [MCR  7166]..  Changed  the  set_ring_brackets  command  to
                support Data Management files.

          T- 2. [MCR NONE].. Added the dm_display_version command to return
                the version of Data Management being used in a process.




          Contents of MR11.0             3-20                         SRB11


          T- 3. [MCR 6887]..  Added the session_type keyword  to the system
                command/active  function to  allow  a  site control  of the
                actions  of  system  startup  dependant  upon  the  type of
                session of Multics service.  For  example, if it is desired
                to suppress the  login of certain daemons then  all that is
                necessary is to change the system_start_up.ec as follows:

                &if [equal  [system  session_type]   special]  &then  &goto
                   no_daemons
                sc_command login IO SysDaemon cord
                sc_command login Utility SysDaemon ut
                .

                .  &label no_daemons

          T- 4. [MCR 6939]..  Deleted the device_meters  command.  Enhanced
                the disk_meters command to functionally replace the deleted
                device_meters command.

          T- 5. [MCR  6967].. Changed the  reductions command to  no longer
                match quoted strings in the source files of rdc-implemented
                translators with absolute syntax specifications or built-in
                syntax  specifications (<name>), <decimal-integer>  or <BS>
                given in the translator's reduction statements.  This is an
                incompatible   change  which   will  probably   not  impact
                application translations implemented with reductions.

          T- 6. [MCR 6897]..  Enhanced analyze_multics to  support analysis
                of dead  processes.  A new tool,  copy_deadproc, copies the
                dead  process directory  for use  by analyze_multics.   The
                site  is  responsible  for  creating  >dumps>save_pdirs  at
                installation  time.  Moved  the ol_dump  tool to >obsolete.
                Retained the  hran_ segment on  bound _azm.  Access  on the
                save_pdirs directory must be set  to sma for *.SysMaint and
                *.SysAdmin and * s for *.*.*.

                When a process is terminated  and then renamed and saved in
                >process_dir_dir, sma access for  SysAdmin and SysMaint are
                automatically given to the renamed process.

          T- 7. [MCR    7116]..   Added    the   encode_access_class    and
                decode_access_class commands to the system; see C&AF manual
                or the info segments for details.  Their immediate function
                is to support the DM software.

          T- 8. [MCR  6972].. Improved  the  syntax  of the  trace command.
                Eliminated the importance of  control argument order so the
                trace  command behaves  like an  ordinary Multics  command.
                Added  and  deleted  some   control  arguments.   The  ones
                eliminated, print messages that suggest alternatives.

                Eliminated the concept of the trace template.  Instead, all
                entrypoints  specified  on  a  command  line assume default


          Contents of MR11.0             3-21                         SRB11


                parameters amended by any  parameters specified on the same
                command  line.  The  -set_defaults control  argument amends
                the default parameters.   Obviously, the default parameters
                are  just   the  old  trace  template   in  disguise.   The
                difference  is that  each control  argument applies  to all
                entrypoints, instead of only the ones that follow it on the
                command line,  and the default parameters  are not modified
                unless the user specifies -set_defaults.

                Added the -signals (on/off) control argument along with the
                ability to trace signals.

                Specifying  "-automatic  on"   forces  "-signals  on",  and
                "-automatic  off"   forces  "-signals  off".   This   is  a
                convenience for  the user because "-automatic  on"" usually
                means the user wants to see everything.

                Trace  now prints  a brief   report of  the effect  of each
                command line.  This can be suppressed by the -quiet control
                argument.

                Improved trace  messages.  In -long mode,  they contain the
                time or the trace event (to the millisecond) and the meters
                for each call.

                The user  can now specify  that an entrypoint  be traced at
                call, return, both, or neither.

                Changed the "-arguments N"  control argument to "-arguments
                in|out|on|off".   Eliminated  the  -in,  -out,  and  -inout
                control arguments.

                Eliminated  the  "-govern  on|off"  control  argument.  Its
                functions can now be controlled separately by the new "-low
                N" and "-stop_low N" control arguments.

                Added the ability to send  the trace information to an 8192
                entry circular trace buffer in the process directory.

                Eliminated the  -return_value control argument.   Trace now
                determines  automatically whether  an entrypoint  returns a
                value.

                Changed trace to display "returns (*)" correctly.

                Added the  watch command to replace the  old -watch control
                argument.  The user can now add and remove entries from the
                watch   table   and   can   specify   locations  using  any
                representation  that is  acceptable to  cv_ptr_.  Increased
                the  maximum  number  of  locations  that  can  be  watched
                simultaneously from 16 to 1024.

          T- 9. [MCR 6974].. ACL commands can now directly set extended ACL
                on  the  various  special  segments  (e.g., mailboxes) that
                exist in the Multics hierarchy.

          T-10. [MCR  6717]..  Replaced  the  dump_vtoce  command  with the
                display_vtoce command.

          T-11. [MCR 6718]..  Replaced the print_aste_ptp command  with the
                display_aste command.

          T-12. [MCR 7038].. Improved a logical create_dir command to allow
                a  logical volume  administrator to  explicitly specify the
                owner and quota account for a master directory.

          T-13. [MCR  6946].. Enhanced  the message  facility.  All message
                facility commands  and active functions now  accept mailbox
                specifications  and,  in  the   case  of  send_message  and
                accept_messages,   mail   addresses.    This   means   they
                understand mail table entries.

                Added     accepting,      last_message_destination,     and
                message_status commands to the message facility.

                Obsoleted     long_message_format,    short_message_format,
                send_message_acknowledge,     send_message_express,     and
                send_message_silent      commands.        Replaced      the
                send_message_acknowledge,     send_message_express,     and
                send_message_silent   commands   with   the   -acknowledge,
                -express, and -silent control arguments to send_message.


                Obsoleted the send_message_  and send_mail_ subroutines and
                replaced         message_facility_$send_message         and
                message_facility_$send_message_access_class   which  accept
                the     same    arguments     as    send_mail_$path     and
                send_mail_$path_access_class.

          T-14. [MCR  6994]..  Added  the  -line_speed  control argument to
                "window_call invoke"  to allow a  user to specify  the line
                speed of the user connection when using the Video System.

          T-15. [MCR 6921].. Changed the list command to return DM files as
                a separate type of directory entry.

          T-16. [MCR   6975]..  Added  the   -data_management_file  control
                argument to  the list command  to return information  on DM
                files.

          T-17. [MCR  6968].. Added  the -bindfile,  -segment, and -archive
                control  arguments to the  bind command.  Added  Ignore and
                Partial_Order  as bindfile   master keywords.   Changed the
                binder  to ignore  zero-length segments  rather than return
                errors.   Removed  the  limit  on  the  number input/update
                archives and object segments  accepted by the bind command.
                Changed  the Addname bindfile  master keyword to  behave as
                documented and  to only add names of  those components that
                have external  symbols retained.  Type  "help bind.changes"
                for more information.

          T-18. [MCR  6555].. Added  the -only_character  and -all  control
                arguments to the dump_segment command.  The -only_character
                control argument  returns only the ASCII  representation of
                the  words dumped.  The  -all control argument  returns all
                data in the segment.

          T-19. [MCR  6905]..  Added  the  -time_format  to  general_ready.
                Changed the default ready message to print date and time in
                the   user's  default   date  and   time  format.   Changed
                -date_time, -date,  and -time to employ  the user's default
                date/time, date, and time formats respectively.

          T-20. [MCR  6749,  6750]..  Added  the  check_sst_size command to
                display the amount of memory used by the ASTE pools in SST.
                Added the check_tc_data_size command  to display the amount
                of memory used by the system tc_data segment and its parts.

          T-21. [MCR 6896]..  Changed the format_pl1 command  to handle pl1
                percent  macro  statements.    Introduced  new  options  to
                control the formatting of  begin-end blocks, procedure body
                indentation,  the  placement  of  statements  after an else
                clause, the  column indentation of line  continuations, and
                the  column indentation  of  the  equal sign  in assignment
                statements.

          T-22. [MCR  6707, 6781]..   Added the  -select_entry_type control
                argument to the entries command to support extended objects
                by returning entrynames of objects of the specified type.

          T-23. [MCR 6849, 6850].. Added four  new control arguments to the
                get_quota  command; the -nonzero  control arg to  list only
                directories with nonzero quota  used, the -sort control arg
                to  sort directories  by the  requested quota  value or  by
                records-used  if  more  than  one  value  is requested, the
                -total control  arg to return  the total quota  used by the
                subtree, and the -zero control arg to list only directories
                with  zero quota  used.  Changed  the -long  control arg to
                return  the  price  computed  from  the  time-page product,
                according to the rate structure of the current process.

          T-24. [MCR  6694 -- approved  and installed].. Added  the term_id
                preaccess   command  to    set  the   4-character  terminal
                identifier (answerback) for the  login session.  Also added
                the  -term-id  control  argument  to  the  login  preaccess
                command to accomplish the same purpose.

          T-25. [MCR   6426  --   approved  and   installed]..  Added   the
                -multisegment_file and -max_length control arguments to the
                create  command.  The  -multisegment_file control  argument
                creates  an  MSF  with   one  zero_length  component.   The
                -max_length  control  argument  sets  the  max  length of a
                created segment.

          T-26. [MCR  6810  --  approved  and  installed]..  Installed  the
                sort_strings   command/active   function   to   sort  input
                arguments in ASCII collating or numeric sequence.

          T-27. [MCR  6684  --  approved  and  installed]..  Installed  the
                format_string  command/active  function  to  format  a text
                string for insertion into an output file or output stream.

          T-28. [MCR  6673 --  approved  and  installed].. Removed  the all
                keyword  from  the  unassign_resource  command.   The  -all
                control argument may be used in its place.

          T-29. [MCR 6660 -- approved  and installed].. Changed the io_call
                command  to  make  the   -nl  and  -nnl  control  arguments
                obsolete.   They  have  been  replaced  by -append_newline,
                -remove_newline,   and   -allow_newline.    The   obsoleted
                arguments have been retained but are no longer documented.

          T-30. [MCR   6565  --   approved  and   installed]..  Added   the
                get_effective_access command to return the user's effective
                access on a  supplied path and the ACL  term which provides
                the effective access.

          T-31. [MCR  7013]..   Two  new  commands,   list_entry_types  and
                describe_entry_type, provide  the ability to find  out what
                entry types  are supported in the current  process and what
                characteristics each entry type has, respectively.

          T-32. [MCR   6612   --    approved   and   installed]..   Changed
                check_info_segs  to no  longer notify  users of  changes to
                zero length  segments, to return normal  output when -brief
                is used and -call is  not supplied where info segments have
                changed,  and to  reject date/time  arguments supplied with
                -date where the date/time is in the future.

          T-33. [MCR 6681 -- approved and installed].. Changed list_help to
                add the -sort and  -no_sort control arguments.  Changed the
                -absolute_pathname control argument to  add the info suffix
                on paths returned.

          T-34. [MCR 6613 -- approved and installed].. Changed the truncate
                command to  operate on an  MSF in the  same manner as  on a
                segment.

          T-35. [MCR   6589   --    approved   and   installed]..   Changed
                translator_absin.absin  and  runoff_abs_absin.absin  to use
                enter_output_request rather than  dprint.  Users are warned
                that  the  use  of  enter_output_request  by  the  absentee
                compilers  and composers  may  cause  value segments  to be
                created  in  the  users'   home  directories  and/or  cause
                messages of the type "Warning, no defaults set for...".

          T-36. [MCR  6582  --  approved  and  installed]..  Added  the all
                keyword to  the user and  system commands to  return in one
                invocation  the information  available through  the use  of
                every  other   keyword  associated  with   the  appropriate
                command.

          T-37. [MCR  6867].. Changed   print_error_message, pel,  peo, and
                peol to work as an active function.

          T-38. [MCR 6868].. Changed the line_length  command to work as an
                active function and return  the current line length setting
                and to set a new line length where maxlength is specified.


          PC SUPPORT


          U- 1. MR11.0.. Kermit  is a public domain  file transfer protocol
                defined by Columbia University.  As a subsystem on Multics,
                it provides a facility  for transferring 8-bit binary files
                and 7-bit  ascii files between microcomputers  and Multics.
                Ascii  files may  also be  transferred between  two Multics
                sites.

          U- 2. [MCR  7045].. Provided  file transfers  between Multics and
                microcomputers   that  support   xmodem  and   ibm-pc-to-pc
                protocols.    Due    to   high-speed   data    input   from
                microcomputers using data  transfer protocols, sites should
                be  aware  of  possible  high  FNP  loading  when using the
                transfer protocols.


          SUBROUTINES


          V- 1. [MCR 7181]..  Added a cleanup handler  to link_trap_caller_
                to  automatically reset  the  first  reference trap  if the
                first  reference trap  procedure  aborts  and the  stack is
                unwound.   However,  no  special  action  is  taken to undo
                anything that the first reference trap procedure might have
                done before it aborted.

          V- 2. [MCR 6937].. Added system_shutdown_scheduled_ IPS signal to
                signal each  process whenever a scheduled  shutdown time is
                set  or changed.   This allows  users to  correctly set  or
                update  timers,  so  that  any  form  of  imminent shutdown
                processing or desired notification can be created.

          V- 3. [MCR  7046].. Changed  the copy_erf_seg_  subroutine to use
                the system  supplied utility, amu_,  to obtain data  from a
                Multics  system  dump.   Incompatibly  changed  the calling
                sequence.  Changed  the tty_dump, tty_analyze,  and extract
                commands  to  use  the  new  calling  sequence.   Any  user
                programs that  use copy_erf_seg_ should be  modified to use
                the new calling sequence.

          V- 4. [MCR  6966].. Changed  window_io_ to  support edited  mode,
                which behaves the same as the tty_io module.

          V- 5. [MCR   6669]..  Improved   reconnection  to   Video  System
                processes  by making  tc_io_  support  a new  control order
                "reconnection",  and making  sus_signal_handler_ first  try
                this   control   on    the   -login_channel   switch   upon
                reconnection.  Reconnecting on a  terminal not supported by
                the video  system no longer  causes a fatal  process error,
                but will result in the  video system being revoked and tty_
                attached.

          V- 6. [MCR 6798]..  Changed the window_io_ I/O  module to support
                the get_editor_key_bindings control order.  This allows the
                application to  get the bindings  of particular keys  or to
                save  the entire key  binding state for  later restoration.
                Enhanced the set_editor_key_bindings control order to allow
                restoration of such a key  binding state.  When setting key
                bindings,  a name,  description, and  info segment pathname
                can now be associated with a key binding.

          V- 7. [MCR 6926].. Deleted  the obsolete tc_request_.incl.pl1 and
                tc_state_.incl.pl1 include files of tc_io_.

          V- 8. [MCR  6796].. Added  the aim_check_$in_range  entrypoint to
                determine  whether  an  authorization  is  within an access
                class range.

          V- 9. [MCR   6804]..   Added   the  convert_aim_attributes_$range
                entrypoint   to   provide    a   brief   installation_parms
                independent representation of an AIM range.

          V-10. [MCR  6775].. Deleted the  undocumented mdc_$get_lv_pv_info
                gate.  Any  site program calling this gate  must be changed
                to call mdc_$lvname_info which returns the same information
                without hacking the disk_table.

          V-11. [MCR 6909]..  Added the aim_util_ subroutine  to manipulate
                AIM  access classes   and authorizations.   Entrypoints are
                get_access_class  to  extract  the  access  class  from  an
                authorization,  get_privileges  to  extract  the privileges
                from a standard AIM authorization, get_level to extract the
                sensitivity  level from  an access  class or authorization,
                get_catagories  to extract  the categories  from a standard
                AIM access class or authorization, and make_access_class to
                construct an access class marking from a level and a set of
                categories.

          V-12. [MCR  6634]..  Removed  the  undocumented  unique_chars and
                unique_bits names  from the unique_chars_  and unique_bits_
                subroutines, respectively.

          V-13. [MCR  6457 --  approved  and  installed].. Changed  ask_ to
                allow y and  n responses to yes/no questions  and added the
                ask_nf, ask_cnf,  and ask_nnf entry points  which require a
                response of "on" or "off".

          V-14. [MCR  6631   --  approved  and  installed]..   Changed  the
                precision  of the  size argument  of decode_descriptor_  to
                fixed  bin(24).   Some  callers  of  decode_descriptor_ saw
                incorrect  sizes, depending  on  whether  their use  of the
                argument prompted the PL/1 compiler to put it into an index
                register.

          V-15. [MCR  6551   --  approved  and  installed]..   Changed  the
                numeric_to_ascii_base_ subroutine to make a non-restartable
                call to  sub_err_ when the base  is outside the range  2 to
                16.  Programs  currently calling this subroutine  depend on
                the out-of-bounds condition being  signalled if the base is
                outside the acceptable range and no longer works correctly.

          W- 1. [MCR  6441,   6448,  6451,  6507,  6481   --  approved  and
                installed]..  Reimplemented tape_archive  using the  mtape_
                I/O module  rather than tape_ibm_ and  tape_ansi_.  Because
                the table format changed, the table version was upgraded to
                4.  A tape_ibm_/tape_ansi_  implementation of tape_archive,
                is in the >obsolete library.

                Several  new  features  and   bug  fixes  are  included  in
                tape_archive  version  4.   Added  the  optional -alternate
                control argument to the 'alter  table density N' request to
                permit  independent  management  of  volume  set densities.
                Mixed  tape drive  configurations are  supported by  always
                including  the  -density  control  argument  on  all  mount
                requests.   Centralized default   density references  to an
                include  file constant.   The 'xd'  and 'xdf'  requests are
                supported in a similar manner to archive.  Specifying -long
                for the 't' request on  an empty table produces long header
                information.    Added   additional    checks   to   prevent
                tape_archive   from   inadvertently   deleting   the  table
                currently being used for processing.

                Because of  the current action  of mtape_ when  -density is
                omitted  (i.e., honoring  the current  density of  the VOL1
                label), it is possible (but  not likely) for a tape_archive
                volume set  to actually be recorded at  a density different
                than  that specified  in the  table.  With  version 4,  the
                recording density  in the table  MUST match the  volume set
                density.   Any  discrepancies  can  be  rectified using the
                'alter table density N' request.

          W- 2. MR11.0..  BASIC was  upgraded to  improve its compatibility
                with  other versions  of BASIC  currently available  in the
                field.   The  commonly  expected  string  functions:  mid$,
                left$, and right$ have been added.   The '+' may be used as
                the concatenation operator.  The last argument of the 'pos'
                function is now optional.

                Due to the nature of the  error and the fix, some users may
                find  the output from  their basic programs  changed.  This
                will depend on whether they  missed noticing the problem in
                the PRINT USING  statement or if they attempted  to use the
                statement by compensating for the error.

                Examples  of the error  and the results  after the fix  are
                listed below to show the possible effects on Basic output.

                These errors could possibly go  unnoticed or the user could
                have  compensated for  them.  In  either case,  the bug fix
                will cause the user's output to be changed.

          X- 1. [MCR 6379].. Changed the calling sequence for the footproc:
                entry  of compose  device procedure  modules from  "returns
                (char   (*)  var)"  to   "returns  ((3)  char   (*)  var)".
                Developers  of private device  modules will have  to modify
                and recompile.

          X- 2. [MCR  6961]..  Discontinued  support  for  the  DTC300S and
                Mergenthaler V-I-P Typesetter and the bound support modules
                are  NOT in  the MR11  release.  Moreover,  it is extremely
                doubtful  that the  old versions   will work  with the  new
                compose.   Thus,  sites  that  are  dependent  on those two
                devices  should  save  the  COMPLETE  old  compose  for the
                dependent  users while  undertaking  an  effort to  get the
                modules working with the  new compose.  HIS/MDC understands
                that this  action is not  particularly friendly, but  it is
                the only option available to us.

          X- 3. [MCR 6963].. Changed the  "typewriter" compose device class
                to  "printer"  and  merged  the  "typesetter"  and  "xerox"
                compose device  classes into "bitmap".  These  name changes
                must  be  made  to  any  local  compdv  input  files before
                recompiling for this release.

          X- 4. [MCR 6964].. The version of  compose in this release has an
                incompatible change in generation of the output page image.
                Any locally  supported (or private) compose  device support
                modules (*.compdv's and *.comp_dsm's)  must be modified and
                recompiled  before  using  this  new  compose.   Sites  are
                advised  to save  the old  compose version  (executable and
                macros) in  some user accessible location  until conversion
                is complete and tested.

          Y- 1. [MCR 6599]..  Changed the Emacs read-file  command to query
                the user if  the current buffer has been  modified since it
                was last  read or written.  The  read-file-force option can
                be turned on  to disable this query, or  a numeric argument
                can be given to ^X^R to  force it to read.  Keyboard macros
                which  intentionally read  into  a  modified buffer  can be
                changed  to provide  a numeric  argument to  ^X^R prior  to
                installing this version of  Emacs.  The previous version of
                Emacs ignored numeric arguments to ^X^R.

          Y- 2. [MCR  6692]..  Changed  Emacs   to  support  the  following
                terminal types:  dku7102, an ANSI-standard terminal made by
                Cii-Bull, and smarterm, Netronics Smarterm-80.

          Y- 3. [MCR 6731].. Changed Emacs  to allow all options documented
                in  CH27  to  be  set  in  a  user's  start_up.emacs  where
                previously the  options for autoloaded packages  could only
                be set after the package was loaded.

          Y- 4. [MCR 6731].. Changed Emacs to zero the unused characters in
                the last word of written segments.

          Y- 5. [MCR 6731].. Changed the Emacs PL/1 Mode, locate-next-error
                command (^X^D), to recognize FATAL ERROR messages.

          Y- 6. [MCR 6731]..  Changed Emacs find-file (^X^F)  to inform the
                user, if it determines that  a specified segment is already
                read  into an  existing  buffer,  that it  is automatically
                selecting that buffer.  Previously,  it selected the buffer
                but  remained  silent.   If  the  default  pathname for the
                buffer no  longer refers to that segment  then the pathname
                is updated.

          Y- 7. [MCR 6731].. Changed Emacs option default settings to:

                     Option = New Default
                     find-file-set-modes = On
                     remember-empty-response = Off
                     paragraph-definition-type = 2

          Y- 8. [MCR 6731].. Changed the default value for the Emacs option
                pl1-compile-options  to  be  the  null  string  rather than
                -table.  The pl1 command implements this default.

          Y- 9. [MCR 7023].. Installed Executive  Forum, a menu driven user

          Y-10. [MCR 6876].. Added new  personalization options, new editor
                features,  and   other  miscellaneous  extensions   to  the
                Executive Mail Facility.

                The  new  personalization  options  include:   an option to
                enable/disable interactive message processing, an option to
                remove the menu from the screen while editing, an option to
                force  the use  of  escape  sequences rather  than function
                keys, an  option to select the outgoing  savebox, an option
                to provide  automatic menus for lists, an  option to enable
                function key 8  for Multics mode, and an option  to set the
                mail  system  "full_name._"  value  for  outgoing messages.
                Obsoleted   and  undocumented  the   -multics_mode  control
                argument, but it will be  supported thru this release.  The
                Personalized Executive  Mail menu can  be used to  set this
                function.

                The new editor features  include:  a built-in help facility
                invoked  by ESC ?,  a request to  insert a Multics  segment
                into the text,  and requests to go to the  start and end of
                the text.

                The  miscellaneous extensions  include:  non-case-sensitive
                escape  sequences,  support  for  blind  carbon  copies,  a
                request  to  write  the  current  messages  to  a  segment,
                automatic  listing  of  current  messages  after selecting,
                three-column  menus to save  screen space, and  an improved
                Multics mode.

          _F_O_R_T_R_A_N


          Z- 1. [MCR  7030]..   Added  a  new  Fortran   control  argument,
                -hexadecimal_floating_point,  to  allow   the  use  of  HFP
                numbers.  Real,  complex, and double precision  numbers can
                have four times  more magnitude in HFP mode  at the expense
                of some precision.  This feature  is supported only on DPS8
                hardware.   Compilations using  the -hfp  control argument,
                and  execution  of  such  programs,  requires  rw access to
                >sc1>admin_acs>Fortran_hfp.acs.    This  segment   must  be
                created by site personnel if sites wish to make use of HFP.

          Z- 2. MR11.0.. The following math routines have been rewritten:

                   sine                  double_sine
                   cosine_               double_cosine_
                   tangent_              double_tangent_
                   arc_sine_             double_arc_sine_
                   arc_tangent_          double_arc_tangent_
                   square_root_          double_square_root_
                   logarithm_            double_logarithm_
                   exponential_          double_exponential_

                The  new routines are  generally more accurate  and faster.
                Unnecessary underflows  and overflows are not  signalled by
                these new routines.


          _F_O_R_U_M


          Z- 3. [MCR 6848].. Installed version 2 Forum.

          Z- 4. [MCR 6848]..  Extensively modified the the  forum subsystem
                for MR11.

                1) The  format of  forum  "meetings"  has been  changed.  A
                   forum  meeting is now  implemented as a  directory which
                   contains  several  segments.   This  format  allows  the
                   proceedings of  a meeting to  grow beyond the  version 1
                   limit of 1 segment.  Other features of interest are:

                   a) The limit of 512 attendees has been removed, although
                      currently all  attendee information still has  to fit
                      into one segment (a  restriction likely to be removed
                      in a future release).

                   b) The  new  format  includes  storage  for  "seen" maps
                      (described below).

                   c) Allows  support  of   forums  meetings  as  "extended
                      objects" which means that they possess extended ACL's


          Contents of MR11.0             3-33                         SRB11


                      and may be moved and  copied with the extended object
                      version of the "move" and "copy" commands.

                   d) Significantly eases future enhancements.

            2) Implementation of "seen" maps.

              Instead of keeping track of the highest seen transaction in a
                   forum meeting,  forum now maintains a bit  map of "seen"
                   transactions for each attendee in a forum.  This feature
                   allows an  attendee to jump around  reading transactions
                   in a meeting without  losing track of which transactions
                   have yet to be read.

                a) New  transaction  specifier  keywords  were  added  that
                   relate to the map of seen transactions they are:

                   seen -- all transactions that have been displayed.

                   unseen -- all transactions not yet displayed.

                   first_unseen  --  first  transaction  that  has not been
                   seen.

                   first_seen -- first transaction that has been seen.

                   next_unseen  -- next  transaction after  the current one
                   that has not been seen.

                   next_seen -- next transaction after the current one that
                   has been seen.

                   last_seen -- highest numbered  transaction that has been
                   seen.

                   last_unseen -- highest numbered transaction that has not
                   been seen.

                b) A new  switch has been  added, the "seen"  switch.  This
                   allows an  attendee to manipulate manually  the state of
                   the  seen switch  for a  transaction.  Typing "switch_on
                   seen unseen" while attending  a forum meeting will cause
                   the  seen switch  to be  set on  all unseen transactions
                   having   the   effect   of   having   read   all  unseen
                   transactions.

            3) New requests.  The following requests  were added in version
                   2 forum:

                   add_meeting            check_meeting     next_meeting
                   announce_meeting       mail

                a) check_meetings  and   next_meeting:   The  check_meeting


          Contents of MR11.0             3-34                         SRB11


                   request scans the forum  search list looking for changed
                   meetings  (those with  new transactions).   It places  a
                   list  of changed meetings  into a per-process  area such
                   that the next_meeting request allows you to step through
                   this list.   The next_meeting request has  the effect of
                   doing  a  "goto"  to  the  next  meeting  in the changed
                   meeting list.  An error is generated if the next_meeting
                   request is used in a process before an invocation of the
                   check_meeting request.

                b) mail:   This  request  allows  a  user  to  mail a forum
                   transaction to a multics mailbox.

                c) add_meeting and  announce_meeting:  the announce_meeting
                   request  allows a forum  user to automatically  place an
                   announcement about  a newly created meeting  either into
                   the public meeting_directory (the pathname of the public
                   meeting_directory  is  determined  by  a  value  in  the
                   forum_data_  cds segment)  or a  private meeting.   This
                   announcement   is  in   a  format   acceptable  to   the
                   add_meeting request.

                The add_meeting request may be  invoked either on a meeting
                   pathname  or  on  a  transaction  number  of  a  meeting
                   announcement, it  then makes links in  the the directory
                   ">udd>[user  project]>[user  name]>meetings"  (a control
                   argument  allows the  user to  specify another directory
                   for  placing  the  link).   If  this  directory does not
                   exist, a  link is created  that points to  the invoker's
                   home directory.

            4) Compatibility  with version  1 forum.   The MR11  version of
                   forum  supports  both  version  2  format  meetings  and
                   version 1  format meeting.  However  not all of  the new
                   features  of forum  are available  for version  1 format

              A tool  has been  provided named  "convert_forum" which  when

                   specified  by including  the ".control"  suffix with its
                   name.  (version 2 meetings use the suffix of ".forum" to
                   distinguish them from version 1 meetings).

                   set_acl  command,   or  from  within  forum   using  the
                   add_participant  and  remove_participant  requests.  The
                   valid modes are one of either:  "r" for read only access
                   "rw" for read/write access "rwc" for chairman capability
                   and  "null"  access  for  no  access.   Anyone with "sm"
                   permission  to  a  meeting's  containing  directory  may
                   manipulate  the ACL  of a   forum.  It  is possible  for
                   multiple  people to  have chairman  capability, although
                   there  is  still  only   one  "chairman  of  record"  as
                   displayed with the "chairman" request.

          Z- 5. [MCR 7001].. Removed the LINUS Report Writer from LINUS and
                made it  available for use by  application programs through
                the report_writer_  subroutine interface.  See  the Multics

          a- 1. [MCR 7047].. Added the dsl_$compile entrypoint which allows
                for  the compilation  and reuse  of a  selection expression
                within a process.

          a- 2. [MCR  7048]..  Added  the  quiesce_quiet  and  quiesce_free
                entrypoints to mmi_ in order  to allow programmers to cause
                a  MRDS data  base to  be placed  in, and  returned from, a
                quiescent state.

          a- 3. [MCR 6984].. Added the copy_mrds_data command.  Data can be
                copied from  one MRDS data  base to another,  regardless of
                type  (vfile_ or  DM).  This   will be  very useful  in the
                conversion of data bases from one type to the other.

                In MR10.2, a new method  of locating and referencing tuples
                was   implemented  in  MRDS.    Upon  the  first   call  to
                dsl_$retrieve, the first N  tuples that match the selection
                expression are located and  locator values for these tuples
                (called tuple_ids)  are saved internally by  MRDS.  For the
                next  N-1   calls  to  dsl_$retrieve   ("-another"),  those
                tuple_ids  are used  to locate  another tuple.   In certain
                situations  that involve  scope settings  that allow  other
                users to modify the relation in question, this introduced a
                problem wherein the data could either be deleted or changed
                so that it no longer matched the selection expression.  The
                value V above is mrds_data_$max_tids_returned_per_call, and
                is  set  to  1000.   A  critical  fix  released  for MR10.2
                alleviated  this problem by  instructing sites, if  they so
                chose, to  set that value to  1, making MRDS slower  in the
                process.

                In  MR11.0 a  more  sophisticated  approach is  taken.  For
                vfile_ data  bases, if the  scope is set  to prevent modify
                and  to  prevent  delete   and/or  store,  the  value  1000
                (mrds_data_$max_tids_returned_per_call) is  used.  For Data
                Management  data  bases,  if  the  user  or  application is
                generating its  own transactions and all  the dsl_$retrieve
                calls are made within the confines of a single transaction,
                that  value  is  used  as   well.   In  other  "Less  safe"
                situations    (vfile_   data   bases    with   insufficient
                preventative scope set or  Data Management data bases where
                more than  one transaction is used) a  new mrds_data_ value
                (mrds_data_$max_safe_tids_returned_per_call) is used.  This
                value is set  to 1.  The site can, at  their option, adjust
                these  values.  The  most likely  modification would  be to
                raise  the value  of max_safe_tids_returned_per_call.   The
                effect of this would be  an increase in performance for the
                "less   safe"  situations,   but  would   leave  open   the
                possibility that  a tuple that did not  match the selection
                expression might be returned in those situations.

          b- 1. [MCR  6591 --  approved and  installed].. Changed  the mrpg

          B- 1. [MCR 7204].. For MR11.0 the  IO Daemon has been modified to
                use version 5 message segments.  The Coordinator and all of
                the Drivers now  use mseg_message_info.incl.pl1 rather than
                mseg_return_args.incl.pl1.   Local drivers must  be changed
                to reflect this change.

          B- 2. MR11.0.. While the  subroutine pnt_manager_ is undocumented
                and is  considered an internal interface, it  is known that
                various sites  have developed tools to  manipulate the PNT.
                The  calling sequence  to the  various pnt_manager_ entries
                was  changed, and any  site programs which  use it must  be
                modified and recompiled.  See  the relevant system programs
                which use pnt_manager_ for examples.

          B- 3. [MCR 7044]..  Changed the error codes returned  by the file
                system when an access violation is attempted.  The previous
                policy was to return error_table_$moderr ("Incorrect access
                on  entry")  or  error_table_$incorrect_access  ("Incorrect
                access to  directory containing entry") unless  the process
                lacked access to see the process' access, in which case the
                returned   code  was   error_table_$no_info  ("Insufficient
                access to return any  information").  Any attempt to access
                a non-existent object returned error_table_$noentry ("Entry
                not  found")  or  some  derivative.   This  policy is being
                superceded  by  a  more  restrictive  policy.   In  the new
                policy,   the   system   returns   error_table_$moderr   or
                error_table_$incorrect_access  only when the  process' have
                access  to see  existence of  the object  of the  attempted
                access.  A  process has access  to see the  existence of an
                object  if  the  process  possesses  nonnull  access to the
                object or to its parent  directory.  When the process lacks
                access  to see  the existence   of the  object, the  system
                returns  error_table_$no_info.    If  the  target   of  the
                attempted  access  does  not   exist,  the  system  returns
                error_table_$noentry  (or some   derivative) only  when the
                process   has  access   to  determine   the  non-existence;
                otherwise, the process receives error_table_$no_info.

                This policy ("no access  to see existence implies no_info")
                is  applied  to  all  attempts  to  refer  to a file system
                object.   The  major  case  in  which  this  policy will be
                apparent  is  when  it  is  no  longer  possible  to add an
                arbitrary  directory to  the search  rules, or  to set  the
                working directory  to an arbitrary directory.   The process
                must  possess  access  to  determine  the  existence of the
                directory in question.

                site-written tools using ms_table_mgr_ must be modified.

          C- 3. MR11.0.. The syserr_log, answering service log, and message
                coordinator logs  were converted to a  new standard format.
                The print_syserr_log command is  deleted, and the print_log
                command  made  obsolete.   The  functionality  of these two
                commands is  replaced with the print_sys_log  command.  The
                monitor_log  command  is  replaced  by  the monitor_sys_log
                command, and the daily_log_process and daily_syserr_process
                commands are  replaced with the  summarize_sys_log command.
                The  trim_syserr_log  is   obsolete  and  the  date_deleter
                program used for the same purpose.

          C- 4. MR11.0..  With the  MR11 conversion   of system  logs to  a
                standard format,  the write_log_ subroutine  was obsoleted.
                Although this subroutine has been an internal, undocumented
                interface, some sites may  have applications which use this
                subroutine.   These applications  muat be  re-written using
                the  new  log_write_  subroutine.   This  routine  is  also
                considered  an  internal  interface  and,  as  such, is not
                documented.   See the programs  which use this  new routine
                for examples of its use.

          D- 1. [MCR  6834].. Incompatibly   changed date/time  software by
                making  time_table_ and  time_data_ obsolete  and replacing
                them with  time_info_ which contains names  of days, zones,
                etc.   in  four  languages.   Sites  may  add  zones and/or
                languages to this table if  needed.  Users are not intended
                to  directly  reference  these  names,  but  that  the user
                request the  needed information via an  appropriate call to
                the  date/time  system.   In  this  way,  language and zone
                defaults  are   taken  care  of  without   the  user  being
                concerned.   The  MR11.0  release  has  all  references  to
                time_table_$zones    removed    from    system    software.
                Discontinued support of time_table_ for MR12.0.  Users must
                learn to use the new facilities by that time.

          D- 2. [MCR  6834].. Incompatibly   changed date/time  software to
                require the user to specify  time zones known to time_info_
                and to no longer allow an offset to be given which does not
                match  the  offset  contained  in  time_info_.   The module
                set_time_zone is  obsolete and will be  deleted for MR12.0.
                Replaced set_time_zone by set_time_default.  It is not plug
                compatible.

                general_ready  to  allow  the  user  to  specify the user's
                default  date/time  strings.   The  -date_time,  -date, and
                -time control  arguments use the user's  default date/time,

                syntax  is no longer  accepted by the  send_message command

                subroutines, respectively.

          I- 2. [MCR  7046].. Changed  the copy_erf_seg_  subroutine to use

          The  following  manuals  are  NO  LONGER  AVAILABLE  for ordering
          purposes:

             -Multics User Ring Input/Output system PLM (last update AN57-00)
             -Message Segment Facility PLM (last update AN69)

          Reorganized the information for Multics administrators, maintainers,
          and operators by consolidating existing data into a new set of
          four documents:

              Multics System Administration Procedures (AK50-03)
              Multics System Maintenance Procedures (AM81-03)
              Multics Administration, Maintenance, and Operations Commands
                (GB64)
              Operator's Guide to Multics (GB61-01)

          The above documents describe the different activities intended to
          be performed by individuals filling the designated roles.

          System  administrators  provide  their  sites  with  a particular
          Multics  operating environment.   They are  responsible for  such
          tasks  as  controlling   and  allocating  resources,  registering
          projects and users, creating  load control groups, setting prices
          on resources,  setting limits on and billing  for resource usage,
          scheduling  system activities such  as hours of  operation, shift
          change times  and unattended service, describing  site parameters
          and setting site options, and assuring system security.

          System maintainers configure and tune the operating system.  They
          are responsible for  such tasks as backing up  and recovering the


          Documentation Changes          C-2                          SRB11


          system,  salvaging and  scavenging, analyzing  crashes, balancing
          disks,  setting  up  I/O  daemons  and  the  message coordinator,
          metering and tuning, and maintaining system data bases.

          All commands designed for use by administrators, maintainers, and
          operators are  described in the Administration,  Maintenance, and
          Operations Commands  manual.  The procedural manuals  function as
          "how to" documents, making reference,  as needed, to the commands
          required    to   implement    the   various    procedures.    The
          Administration,  Maintenance,  and   Operations  Commands  manual
          complements  the  procedural  manuals  by  providing  a  detailed
          description of the commands.

          Operators are responsible for everyday central site services such
          as  system  startup  and  shutdown,  mounting  and  demounting of
          storage devices, operation of the I/O daemons, communication with
          remote users, and first-level maintenance.


          For the convenience of new user sites, a complete list of Multics
          manuals is provided below.  (When  ordering manuals for the first
          time,  users  need  only  specify  the  four-character base order
          number; the distribution center will ship the latest revision.)

                                   DATA MANAGEMENT





          MR11.0  substantially  enhances   Multics  Date  Management  (DM)
          facilities.   The new  facility supports  the Multics  Relational
          Data Store (MRDS) system.  It provides:

            -  Transaction definition,  several actions are  now considered
               atomic  by  the  system  (e.g.,  MRDS  secondary indexes are
               always accurate).
            -  Improved concurrency control.
            -  Recovery from process and Multics system failure.

          The  user  should  read  the  "Data  Management  Overview" in the
          Multics Programmer's Reference Manual  (Order No.  AG91) for more
          information.  Additional, information on the  use of DM is in the
          MRDS  manual and the  various command, subroutine,  and condition
          descriptions (see "Multics System Changes" below).

          MRDS Support, DM Files, Transaction Support, Concurrency Control,
          Recovery/Rollback  of  DM  Files,  Before  Journals,  and Multics
          System Changes are discussed in this section.


          _M_R_D_S _S_U_P_P_O_R_T

          In this  release, the primary purpose  of DM is to  support MRDS.
          To  do this, several  changes were made  to MRDS (refer  to "Data
          Management  System  Interface"  in  the  MRDS  Manual  (Order No.
          AW53).

          Users may now choose between MRDS  data bases based on the vfile_
          I/0 module (vfile_ DBs), or  on the new Data Management protected
          files (DM DBs).  By default,  MRDS creates vfile_ DBs for MR11.0,
          but  the  user  may  get  the  benefits  of  DM  DBs by using the
          -data_management_file  control  argument  to  the  create_mrds_db
          command.  The copy_mrds_data command was  added to allow users to
          easily convert existing vfile_ DBs to DM DBs.

          Some of the benefits of using a DM DB over a vfile_ DB are:


          Data Management                D-1                          SRB11


            - Tuple updates  cannot be interrupted, thus  secondary indexes
               are never inconsistent with their associated tuple.
            -  The  granularity  of  concurrent  access  is  at the control
               interval  (page)  level,  not  the  entire  relation (unless
               specified).
            -  Any number of MRDS operations  can be done as one operation,
               allowing multiple,  logically connected tuple updates  to be
               done atomically.
            -  DM files are always automatically recovered to an internally
               consistent  state, even  if a  user process  or the  Multics
               system  fails, thereby  keeping all  of a  DM DBs  relations
               internally consistent.
            - Tuple   ID  lists  (TIDs)   remain  valid  within   a  single
               transaction.

          Users need not immediately change applications after converting a
          vfile_ DB to a DM DB.  Users get some of the benefits immediately
          (e.g.,  recovery)  if  the  new   DM  DB  is  put  directly  into
          production, or the  user can do testing with the  new style DB to
          decide what changes to make  to an application before putting the
          converted DB  into production (e.g.,  not using prevent  scope as
          much).  To aid in this,  MRDS was modified to automatically start
          a transaction for each dsl_ call if a DM DB is being accessed and
          no transaction is in progress (see "Transaction Support" below).

          Note  that  DM  DBs  have  a  cost  associated  with the benefits
          received, the  most notable being a relatively  large increase in
          the amount of  time to modify or store a  tuple.  Retrievals also
          take  about 1.8 times  longer when using  DM DBs than  for vfile_
          DBs.  A data base may not have some relations based on vfile_ and
          others on DM in this release.

          Unless otherwise noted, the remainder  of this section deals with
          DM DBs;  the mechanisms are  not available for  vfile_ DBs (e.g.,
          recovery).


          _D_M _F_I_L_E_S

          There are two types of DM files:  protected and unprotected.

          The protected files are used to  implement MRDS DM DBs.  They can
          only be accessed via DM software and are currently implemented as
          MSFs whose component segments have  the synchonized switch ON and
          a write bracket of the DM  ring (i.e., 2).  To access a protected
          DM  file, the  process must   be in  a transaction.   Support for
          synchronized segments was added in MR10.2.

          Unprotected DM  files are used  to create "before"  journals (see
          below)  and temporary  relations.  Since  the temporary relations
          are a  per-process construct, there is no  requirement to provide
          concurrency  or  consistency  protection  from  process or system
          failure.


          Data Management                D-2                          SRB11


          _T_R_A_N_S_A_C_T_I_O_N _S_U_P_P_O_R_T

          A  transaction defines  the beginning  and the  end of  a set  of
          operations,  to protected  DM files  to be  handled as  an atomic
          unit.   This frees  a user  from concern  of conflict  with other
          users, the  hassles of inconsistent  data bases after  process or
          system failure, or undoing some work  already done if an error is
          found.   The   transaction  is  the  controlling   force  for  DM
          concurrency  control  and  rollback/recovery.   As  a  DM  DB  is
          implemented  with protected  DM files,  a transaction  must be in
          effect when operating on such a data base.

          As  described above, a  transaction is a  means for defining  and
          implementing a  grouping of arbitrary data base  operations as an
          atomic unit.  All of the operations are either done, or in a case
          where they  cannot be completed,  partial results are  undone and
          the  data base is  left as it  was before the  transaction began.
          Users define the  beginning and the end of a  transaction; in the
          case where the user does not explicitly start a transaction, each
          MRDS dsl_ call  wraps itself in one (thereby  guaranteeing the DB
          never becomes  internally inconsistent and secondary  indexes are
          consistent with their associated tuple).

          Take the case of a user doing a DB update that requires inserting
          or modifying several tuples as  if the updates were one operation
          (e.g., adding a new employee to a personnel DB and a payroll DB).
          Using vfile_ DBs, it is possible  for the updating process to die
          after adding the employee to  the personnel data base, but before
          adding the employee to the payroll  data base (or even making one
          of  the DBs  internally inconsistent).   But, when  using DM DBs,
          either both tuples  are stored, or neither are  stored.  The data
          bases are  guaranteed to remain internally  consistent across any
          process or system failure.

          After finishing  the transaction, it should be  committed.  If an
          error occurs, or the user  notices an inconsistency in some data,
          the transaction  should be aborted.   If the transaction  is only
          associated  with retrievals  there is  effectively no  difference
          between  commit and  abort.  If  ANY modification  to a  DM DB is
          done, the commit makes ALL the  change(s) a permanent part of the
          DB(s).  An abort undoes ALL changes.  If the user wishes to abort
          the  transaction, but cannot  (e.g., the data  base administrator
          deletes the user's access to  a relation the user modified), then
          the transaction  should be abandoned, letting  a caretaker Daemon
          process abort it (see "Recovery/Rollback" below).

          In MR11.0,  only one transaction  may exist per  Multics process.
          The  transaction  command's  default  action  is  to  suspend any
          started  transaction if any  fault condition is  detected.  ALso,
          MRDS was modified to suspend  the dsl_ started transaction if any
          condition  is not handled  before it is  signalled past the  dsl_
          subroutine.  This  prevents work from accidently being  part of a
          transaction  the work  is not  related to.   For example,  a user


          Data Management                D-3                          SRB11


          remembers something to  do on data base Z when data  base X and Y
          are being modified, hits BREAK, and tries to access Z; the access
          to Z fails because of the suspended transaction.

          This release does not support multiple or nested transactions.

          The  user  should  read  the  documentation  associated  with the
          transaction command in the  Multics Commands and Active Functions
          Manual (Order No.  AG92)  and the transaction_manager_ subroutine
          in  the Multics  Subroutines and  I/O Modules  Manual (Order  No.
          AG93) for  more information.  (Documentation for  the transaction
          command and the transaction_manager_  subroutine is duplicated in
          the MRDS manual.)


          _C_O_N_C_U_R_R_E_N_C_Y _C_O_N_T_R_O_L

          DM concurrency control locks on  a control interval (page) basis,
          not a relation  basis; this can yield less conflicts  of DB usage
          than  under the  current relation   based model.   More than  one
          transaction  may update  the same  relation simultaneously.  Each
          transaction holds  its locks until  it is finished  (committed or
          aborted).   There is  no possibility   of users  reading a  tuple
          written in a transaction not yet committed, or a user modifying a
          tuple  read  by  a  transaction  not  yet  finished.  This is not
          noticed by  applications opening data bases in  an exclusive mode
          or setting very restrictive "prevent" scope.

          Each transaction progresses until it attempts to access a control
          interval with a write lock held.   At that point, the second (and
          succeeding)  transaction(s)  are  forced  to  wait  for the prior
          transaction  to either commit  or abort.  DM  concurrency control
          uses  this  serialization  mechanism.   If  a  process  times out
          waiting  for  a  lock,  the  transaction  is  rolled back and the
          transaction_lock_timeout_ condition is signalled.

          Deadlock detection is always in effect.  The youngest of a set of
          deadlocked  transactions is  forced by  the system  to be  rolled
          back.   This  guarantees  a  sufficiently  persistent transaction
          eventually  completes in  spite of  repeated deadlock situations.
          The user  is informed of a deadlock  by the transaction_deadlock_
          condition after the transaction is  rolled back.  If MRDS started
          the  transaction, it is  rolled back and  retried.  If the  retry
          fails, the  transaction is aborted;  in other cases,  the user is
          responsible for handling the condition.


          _R_E_C_O_V_E_R_Y_/_R_O_L_L_B_A_C_K _O_F _D_M _F_I_L_E_S

          DM  ensures the consistency  of all given  data, regardless of  a
          transaction,  process, or  Multics system  interruption.  In  all
          cases, any modified areas of a  protected DM file are restored to
          their original  contents.  The user  can rollback any  in process


          Data Management                D-4                          SRB11


          modifications by aborting the  transaction.  If the process doing
          modifications fails, a caretaker Daemon rolls back the effects of
          the transaction.   In the case of a  Multics interruption (either
          crash or shutdown), the caretaker Daemon undoes any modifications
          on the NEXT Multics bootload, before DM is available to users.

          Rollback  is when  a transaction  is aborted  or abandoned,  or a
          process   fails.   Recovery  is   rolling  back  from   a  system
          interruption.  Both use the same mechanisms of a "before" journal
          that holds  the information needed to restore  protected DM files
          to their pre-transaction state.  The operations currently able to
          be undone are:  writing or modifying a file, creating a file, and
          deleting a file.

          Recovery may be  done even if a Multics  Emergency Shutdown (ESD)
          fails.   Non-ESD  crashes  are  handled  by  virtue  of  the page
          synchronization  between DM  and Multics  page control  for those
          files with  the sychronized switch ON.   This protocol guarantees
          that a modified control interval is not written to disk until the
          modification's  "before"  image  is  written  to  disk;  this  is
          referred to as the Write-Ahead-Log (WAL) protocol.

          There are  rare cases where  recovery is not  guaranteed to work.
          One  of these situations  is a media  failure (e.g., a  disk head
          crash)  and a  non-intact file   system.  The  media failure  can
          currently be recovered by reloading a  user dump of the lost data
          base  and re-applying  changes made   since the  last dump;  this
          failure  is extremely rare.   Another recovery problem  can occur
          when the file system is not intact (e.g., one or more directories
          are destroyed in a non-ESD crash).  For this reason, sites should
          set  the  dirlock_writebehind  tuning  parameter  ON,  either  by
          invoking the  change_tuning_parameters command or adding  a "PARM
          DIRW" config card to the Multics configuration deck.


          _B_e_f_o_r_e _J_o_u_r_n_a_l_s

          Before Journals (BJ) are used to store a "before" image of a file
          area being modified.  BJs are implemented as unprotected DM files
          in ring  2 (the DM  ring of execution).   A system default  BJ is
          created for  users, or users  may create their  own.  A journal's
          size  must  be  specified  at  creation  time,  and  all  control
          intervals  of the BJ  are initialized.  So,  if a user  wishes to
          make a BJ with a max size of 400 CIs, 400 pages of quota are used
          by the BJ when the creation process is finished.

          In addition,  BJs are recognized  by the new  extended entry type
          file system  interface.  Thus the standard ACL  commands can work
          on a BJ.  There is also  a new command, bj_mgr_call, for creating
          BJs,  setting  which  BJ  a  process  uses,  etc.   (Refer to the
          bj_mgr_call  command and  the before_journal_manager_  subroutine
          descriptions for more information).



          Data Management                D-5                          SRB11


          It is possible  for a BJ to fill up.   Any process detecting this
          situation cannot  write to the  BJ and the  transaction is rolled
          back and the transaction_bj_full_ condition is signalled.

          The  following paragraphs  briefly describe  changes made  to the
          Multics system to support Data Management.


          _M_R_1_0_._2 _H_a_r_d_c_o_r_e _S_u_p_p_o_r_t _(_S_y_n_c_h_r_o_n_i_z_e_d _S_e_g_m_e_n_t_s_)

          Added support in MR10.2 for sychronized segments, which protected
          DM files are  currently based upon.  Also added the  DBMJ card to
          the  allowable  cards  in  the  Multics  config  deck.  This card
          indicates  the  maximum  number  of  BJs  allowed  to  be  opened
          simultaneously, the  maximum number of  pages allowed to  be sync
          held  in memory at  any given time  (determining the size  of the
          hardcore segment dm_journal_seg_), and the number of synchronized
          segments (not files) allowed to have  an AST entry (on a per-pool
          basis).   (Refer  to  the  Multics  System Maintenance Procedures
          Manual (Order No.  AM81) for more information concerning the DBMJ
          config card).


          _D_a_t_a___M_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t_._D_a_e_m_o_n

          Added  Data_Management as  the new  user identity  to the  Daemon
          project.   This Daemon  is responsible   for:  booting  a new  DM
          system  (and  doing  any   recovery  necessary  from  a  previous
          bootload); shutting down a DM bootload (usually close to the time
          Multics shuts down) to lessen the amount of recovery necessary at
          the next bootload; and be caretaker  for the DM bootload while it
          is running (adjusting transactions abandoned  by users or by user
          process failure, garbage collection on DM system tables).

          For  those sites  where MR11.0   is the  first release  used, the
          accounting start_up  automatically registers this  Daemon.  Sites
          running  a previous Multics  release must add  the new Daemon  to
          their PNT,  etc.  For those sites utilizing  the Access Isolation
          Mechanism (AIM),  the Daemon must be  given a login range  of the
          lowest utilized AIM classification to the highest.  (Refer to the
          System  Administration Procedures  Manual (Order  No.  AK50)  for
          more information about this Daemon.)

          Added  dm_hcs_  and  dm_hphcs_  gates  to  call  hardcore support
          routines from  the DM ring  (ring 2).  The  dm_hcs_ gate contains

          dm_hphcs_ gate is a highly  privileged interface that should only
          provide re access for the Data_Management.Daemon.

          Added  the dm_shutdown_scheduled_  IPS  to  inform all  DM System
          (DMS) users  of a change  in the scheduled  down time of  the DMS
          (usually  a short  time before  Multics shutdown).   In addition,
          added the system_shutdown_scheduled_ IPS  to inform the DM Daemon
          of  an upcoming  Multics shutdown  so it  can re-schedule  the DM
          shutdown if necessary; the default static handler for this IPS is
          a no-op for all users except the DM Daemon in MR11.0.

          The   Data_Management.Daemon  should   have  r   access  to   the
          answer_table, absentee_user_table, and  daemon_user_table; and rw
          access  to bump_user.acs  and process_termination_monitor.acs  in
          >sc1>admin_acs.

          Added a new  interface to support extended file  system types.  A
          DM file  is considered a  standard type, along  with directories,
          segments, and MSFs.  As mentioned above, BJs are an extended file
          type  based on  DM files.   (Refer to  the "File  System Extended
          Entry  Types"  described  earlier  in  this  SRB  for  additional
          information.)

          NOTE:  The various retrieval  mechanisms (e.g., volume retriever)
          only  retrieve DM  files if  the request  is made  from ring 2 or
          lower  in   MR11.0.   This  requires  users   to  contact  system
          maintenance personnel  for retrieval (as is the  case for version
          two fora).


          _N_e_w _C_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n_s

          Added the following new standard  conditions to the system (refer
          to  "Handling Unusual  Occurrances" in  the Multics  Programmer's
          Reference  Manual (Order No.   AG91) for details  on the use  and
          handling of these conditions).

          _U_s_e_r _I_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e_s

          Added   the  -data_management_file    control  argument   to  the
          create_mrds_db command.  Installed  the copy_mrds_data command as
          a tool to copy a vfile_ DB to a DM DB.  (Refer to the MRDS Manual
          (Order No.  AW53) for additional information.)

          Added the following  commands to the user interface  to handle DM


          Data Management                D-7                          SRB11

               create_dm_file                transaction

          Added the following subroutines for handling DM files.  (Refer to
          the Multics Subroutines and I/O  Modules Manual (Order No.  AG93)
          for additional information.)

               before_journal_manager_

          Added the following administrator commands.  (Refer to the System
          Administration,  Maintenance,  and   Operations  Commands  Manual
          (Order No.  GB64) for additional information.)

               before_journal_meters         dm_lock_status

               dm_lock_meters                dm_system_shutdown

          Also,  DM logs  have ring  brackets of  the DM  ring (2)  and are
          accessed   via   the   new   system   logging   software   (e.g.,
          print_sys_log)  by  using  the  -dm_system_log  control argument.
          (Refer to the  earlier write up of the new  logging software, and
          the System Administration manuals for additional information.)


          _U_s_e_r _R_i_n_g _t_o _D_M _R_i_n_g _G_a_t_e_s

          There are three new gates for applications running between the DM
          ring  (2)  and  ring  5  to  use  DM.   The  dm_gate_  is totally
          unprivileged  and  should  have  access  of  re  to  *.*.*.   The
          dm_admin_gate_ administrative gate should have access terms of re
          to Data_Management.Daemon and re  to *.SysAdmin.  The most highly
          privileged DM gate is dm_daemon_gate_; the only access term on it
          should be re to Data_Management.Daemon; a site may also choose to
          allow  a maintanence  project (e.g.,  *.SysMaint) access  to this
          gate,   but   it   should   be   very   rarely   used  except  by
          Data_Management.Daemon.   All  of  these  gates  should have ring
          brackets  of  1,2,5  as  some  ring  one  processes  examine  the
          attributes of DM  files, but these processes do  not actually use
          DM facilities.

          If a problem  is found, the normal reporting  mechanism should be
          used.  Each  report must contain  the version of  the DM software
          being used, as found by running the dm_display_version command on
          the system experiencing the problem.

          phx16253 (byte command/af (rank.pl1))
               The  "byte"  command/af  does   not  implement  the  control
               arguments -octal and -decimal,  yet it quietly accepts them.
               It  should  punt  a  la   et_$badopt  as  it  does  for  the

          phx16395 (fortran)
               Fortran generates a "too many  tokens" error for the case of
               a Hollerith constant followed on the next line by a labelled
               statement.

               dial_out  seems to  put the   line into  breakall mode  even

          phx16398 (ssu_ (ssu_error_))
               The calling  sequence in the  call to assign_  is backwards.
               This is not a serious problem,  as I don't imagine there are
               many  callers of ssu_error_  which pass character  string or
               bit string codes.

               Not releasing a temp segment.
          phx16408 (dial_ctl_)
               If a  process is using  a dial out  channel when it  takes a
               fatal  process error  (or maybe  new_proc too),  the channel
               will  be unusable  until it  is removed  and attached.   The
               error  message returned  on subsequent  tries is  "undefined

               A dial  out channel can get  out of sync between  ring 0 and
               the  AS  because  tty_index  sets  wtcb.dialing,  then calls

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
