     This  document  has  been  prepared  automatically  from the
system source by Multics Software Support.  Every effort has been
made  to supply  documentation for  each and  every message  that
could appear either on the system console, or in the system logs.
However,  some of the  system messages are  not provided in  this
document due  to the messages developed prior  to the development
of  the  error  messages  document,  or  omitted  in  error.  The

     For each message,  an example of the text of  the message is
provided, followed by four  paragraphs:  Severity, Time, Meaning,
and Action.


_M_e_s_s_a_g_e _E_x_a_m_p_l_e

     The message example  is a literal copy of  the message, with
substitutable fields  shown in all capitals.   Each substitutable
field is described in the Meaning paragraph.


_O_u_t_p_u_t

     The output  field describes how the message  is output.  For
hardcore  messages  it  shows  the  interpretation  of  the first
argument to SYSERR, which  determines whether the system crashes,
sounds  the  beeper,  etc.   For  answering  service messages, it
describes the output stream and source.


_T_i_m_e

     The  time section  describes the  time when  the message  is
possible.


_M_e_a_n_i_n_g

     The meaning paragraph describes  the situation that prompted
the  message and the  probable cause of  the situation.  It  then
describes  the  consequences  of  the  situation.   Substitutable
parameters in the message example are explained here.


_A_c_t_i_o_n

     The  action  paragraph  describes  what  operator  action is
required when the message occurs.

          RCP:   Mount Reel  REELID with(out)  ring on  DRIVE for
PERSON.PROJ.T (switching volumes).


     Stream:   BOS Typewriter (sounds beeper)

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  A user process has requested the mounting of
                         tape reel REELID on drive DRIVE.

     Action:   Locate the requested reel.
                         Check  to   make  sure  that   the  user
               PERSON.PROJ is allowed to use the reel.
                         Insert  or   remove  a  write   ring  as
               specified.
                         Mount the reel on the specified drive.

                         If  the reel  cannot be  mounted, either
               because it
                         cannot be located,
                         access is incorrect,
                         or the drive is down,
                         use the "x deny"  function to reject the
               mount request.

label NAME.  (User requested volume DIFFERENT_NAME.)


     Stream:   BOS Typewriter (sounds beeper)

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  The operator must verify  that the correct pack is
               mounted on  DRIVE.  If the  DIFFERENT_NAME message
               indicates  that the  label on  the pack  (NAME) is

               instructions from the system administrator must be
               followed.

     Action:   If  the pack  is correct   then use  the "x  auth"
               function to input the DRIVE and the authentication
               code which matches  LABEL_TYPE:  "ss" for "Storage

UNREGISTERED.


     Stream:   BOS Typewriter (sounds beeper)

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  The tape volume requested is not a registered tape
               volume.   In addittion,  the system  may not  have
               been able  to determine that the  volume loaded is

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  The  system cannot  determine that  the volume  on
               DRIVE  is the  one requested.   The operator  must
               authenticate the volume.  The  label read from the
               tape  on DEVICE  was  of  type LABEL_TYPE  and was

               ANSI  and   LABEL  is  "<label>   (with  non-blank
               accessibility code)" this indicates that the label
               is an ANSI label with a non-blank character in the
               accessibility field, the operator must consult the
               site  standards  for   authenticating  such  tapes
               before    doing     the    authentication.     Any
               non-printable   characters   in   the   label  are
               represented by ".".

     Action:   If  the volume  is correct  then use  the "x auth"

     Meaning:  The  version number  stored  in  the SAT  does not
               match  the  expected  version  number,  which is a
               constant in the  Answering Service programs.  This
               may  be because  the  SAT  has been  destroyed, or
               because  an  incorrect  version  of  the Answering
               Service  programs  is   being  used.   This  error
               crashes the system.

     Action:   Contact the  system programming staff.   They have
               to  either  generate  a  new  SAT,  or install the
               correct version  of the Answering Service.   If no
               system programmers are available, enter admin mode
               and attempt to retrieve a  recent copy of the SAT.
               Then exit from admin mode and try startup again.

               successfully.  The  user's wait point is  N.  If N
               is  8, the user  was trying to  log out.  If  N is
               less than 8,  the user was trying to  log in.  The
               user got  the message "hangup" and  his phone hung
               up.   All system  tables were  salvaged as  far as
               possible, an Answering Service dump was performed,

               message comes up on every  login and logout, it is
               probably wise to shut  the system down and perform
               a bootload operation.

               absolute sector  number in octal.  The  main store
               address being used was AAAA.  The third line gives
               the  hexadecimal value  of the  detailed status in

     Time:     Volume demounting and system shutdown time.

     Meaning:  At some time during the  use of volume PVNAME, the
               system encountered problems  which left the volume
               in an  inconsistent state.  The effect  of this is
               that  some  free  records  and/or  free VTOCEs are
               unavailable   (lost)   to   the   system.    These

               is  typed when  the person  tries to  log in.  The
               login  was   attempted  from  the   terminal  with
               identification code ID, using channel CHANNEL.

     Action:   Unless the  system administrator has asked  you to
               watch  for this  message, ignore  it.  The  system
               administrator can  locate this message in  the log
               and is presumably watching for it.

     Stream:             as (severity0)

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  The count  of the active  users on a  project went
               negative.   This is  most likely  the result  of a
               logic error in the  answering service or a damaged

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  The  user identified by  NAME on the  project PROJ
               has either forgotten his  password or someone else
               is trying to guess it.  The system has refused the
               login  for  an  installation-specified  number  of

     Time:     While  the  system  is  running  or  during system
               startup.

     Meaning:  Either  some system  table has  been damaged  or a
               system  administrator  was   changing  work  class
               definitions at the time of a shift change, or when

               immediately   preceding  this  one   contain  more
               information about the exact nature of the problem.

     Action:   Contact the system administrator.  He may want you
               to  type  the  "maxu  auto"  command  to retry the
               operation that  failed.  If that  command produces

     Meaning:  The system  administrator has designated  that the
               project PROJ  should be in the  load control group
               GRPID but the entry  in the master_group_table for
               that  load  control  group  is  missing.  The user
               cannot log in.  This may be an indication that the

               bumped,  but  all  users  have  primary status and
               cannot  be  bumped.   This   situation  may  be  a
               consequence   of  system   programmers  with   the
               overloading privilege  logging in when  the system

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  This message  is typed out when a  user is bumped.
               A user may be bumped by another member of his load
               control  group, in  which case  REASON is  pr_grp,
               which means group preemption.  If a secondary user
               is bumped by a primary  user, either from the same
               group  or from  another group,  REASON is  pr_sec,
               meaning secondary  user preemption.  If  REASON is
               pr_emrg,  meaning emergency  preemption, a  system
               programmer  was logging  in and  had to  bump some

               that  the user  NAME.PROJ  should  be in  the load
               control  group GRPID,  but the  master_group_table

load_ctl_:  maxu too small (XX), YY units for group GRPID


     Stream:   as (severity2).

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  The  system administrator  has specified  that the
               load control group GRPID is to have "all the rest"
               of the  primary load units after  all other groups
               have   taken  their  allocations   from  maxunits.
               However,  maxunits is  less  than  the sum  of the
               primary  allocations, giving  the group  GRPID the
               negative  allocation  of  YY  units.   The  system
               proceeds,  attempting to  log the  user in anyway.
               Of  course, the  user is  allowed secondary status
               only if he  is allowed to log in at  all.  This is
               often  the result of  the operator typing  maxu 30
               instead of maxu 300, or some similar error.

     Action:   Check the value of maxunits  and, if a mistake was
               made,  correct  it.   If  the  maxunits  value  is
               correct,  note  this   situation  for  the  system

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  An  attempt was  made to  set sst$tfreep  to zero.
               The  supervisor  checks  for  this  situation  and
               crashes here when one entry remains in the trailer
               segment in order to trap an elusive bug which used
               to cause "trailer  storage area exhausted" crashes
               when  the  trailer  segment  was  not  full.  This
               indicates a logic error  in the supervisor, or CPU
               or memory  hardware problems.  This  error crashes
               the system.

     Action:   Follow normal recovery procedures.  Be sure to get
               a dump.

seg_fault:  trailer storage area exhausted


     Stream:   BOS Typewriter (Crashes system)

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  There  are no more  free entries available  in the
               system  trailer  segment,  str_seg.   This  may be
               indicative of software- or hardware-induced damage
               to the SST  or str_seg, or may be  indicative of a
               number of logged-in processes  which is vastly too
               large.   A  more  likely  cause  is insufficiently
               large  str_seg.  The  size of  the str_seg  can be
               changed by  the TBLS STR card in  the config deck.
               This indicates a logic error in the supervisor, or
               CPU  or  memory  hardware  problems.   This  error
               crashes the system.

     Action:   Follow  normal  recovery  procedures.   It  may be
               necessary to  increase the size of  the str_seg by
               the TBLS STR card in  the config deck.  Be sure to
               get a dump.

               BOS CPU  from the bootload SCU  maintenance panel,
               taking only the new BOS  CPU out of STEP mode, and
               doing an  EXECUTE SWITCHES on that  CPU.  Once the
               system has crashed successfully,  an ESD should be
               attempted.  This will most likely succeed.



shutdown:   Condition  CCCC  signalled  during  shutdown.  Normal
shutdown failed.  Try an ESD.


     Stream:   BOS Typewriter (Crashes system)

     Time:     System shutdown

     Meaning:  During  the attempt  to shut  down the  system, an
               unexpected condition has been signalled.  This may
               result from hardware problems, or a logic error in
               the supervisor.  The system crashes and returns to
               BOS, whereupon an ESD should be attempted in order
               to finish  flushing Multics information  from main
               memory.     Because   of    the   difference    in
               implementation between normal shutdown and ESD, it
               is possible  that ESD will not  encounter the same
               problem, and instead be successful.

     Meaning:  Shutdown stops all but the BOS processor.  The CPU
               whose tag is TAG could not be stopped.

     Action:   Note  for system  programmer action.   If shutdown
               fails, put all CPU's  other than the BOS processor
               in  step, return to  BOS manually, and  attempt an

shutdown_file_system:  Error deactivating.  Quota may be bad.


     Stream:   BOS Typewriter.

     Time:     System shutdown

     Meaning:  The attempt to deactivate all segments in the file
               system  by a  tree-walk of  threaded ASTEs failed,
               likely due  to inconsistent threading in  the SST.
               The segments will be  deactivated by a linear walk
               of   the  SST.    Quota  inconsistencies   may  be
               introduced by  this.  These can be  corrected by a
               quota salvage of the hierarchy.

     Action:   At a  convenient time, run a quota  salvage of the
               hierarchy.

               During emergency shutdown, this is to be expected.
               During normal shutdown, this may be symptomatic of
               software problems.

               note for system programming staff.

     Meaning:  The idle process for the bootload CPU could not be
               started.   This  may  be  an  error  in setting of
               configuration switches, or may  be indicative of a
               logic problem in the supervisor.

     Action:   Perform  an emergency   shutdown.  Check  all main
               module configuration  switches.  If a  problem was
               corrected,  reboot.  Otherwise,  be sure  to get a

     Meaning:  The segment "prds"  in >system_library_1 could not
               be renamed to PRDSNAME,  which is the correct name
               for   the  PRDS    for  the   bootload  processor.
               ERRORMESSAGE is a standard error_table_ message.

     Action:   Notify  the  system   programming  staff.   Action
               should be taken by the programming staff to rename
               this  segment.  If  the problem  cannot be  sorted
               out, avoid  reconfiguring the bootload  CPU during

               memory modules, especially the  CPU STEP switch on
               the  CPU which  could not  be added,  and its port

               tags.   Normally this  message will  not appear if
               the bootload  CPU is mis-specified, as  this error
               will be  detected by scas_init, and  thus this may
               be indicative of a supervisor logic problem.

     Action:   Check that  all CPU CONFIG cards  are correct.  If
               not, perform an  emergency shutdown, correct them,
               and  reboot.  If  so, be  sure to  get a  dump and

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture
