09/22/87  display_error_list, del

Syntax: 	del {NAME} {-control_args}


Function:
Allows the interrogation of "standard" error lists created by the
edit_error_list command.  In the default mode of operation,
display_error_list enters a request loop where it reads user requests
from the terminal until the quit request causes it to exit.


Arguments:
NAME
   is an error list name.  If NAME does not have a suffix of
   error_list, then one is assumed.  However, the suffix error_list
   must be the last component of the segment.  If NAME contains a
   "<" or a ">" then it will be used as the pathname of the
   error_list.  Otherwise, the error_list search list will be used
   to find NAME.  The default error_list search list is
   >doc>iis>error_lists.


Control arguments:
-abbrev, -ab
   enables abbrev processing within display_error_list. If this
   argument is specified and the -profile control argument is
   not given, then the users default (Personid.profile) profile 
   is used.
-profile PATH, -pf PATH
   causes abbrev processing using PATH. The suffix ".profile"
   need not be given, however, ".profile" must be the last
   component of PATH.
-request STR, -rq STR
   specifies an initial request line to be executed prior to
   entering the request loop.
-request_loop, -rql
   specifies that the display_error_list request loop be entered.
   This is the default.
-quit
   exits after performing any operations specified by control
   arguments.  The default is to enter the request loop.


-prompt STR
   changes the prompt for edit_error_list request lines to STR.  If
   STR is "", the user is not prompted.  -prompt access 
   "STR^[(^d)^]:  " which takes the form STR(N):, where N is the
   recursion level if greater than one.  The default prompt is
   "del(N):". 
-no_prompt
   stops prompting for del requests.  Equivalent to -prompt "". 
-tr PATH
   causes del to search PATH for a TR number. If a TR number is
   found, del will search the specified error list for entries that
   contain the TR number. The "latest" entry containing the TR number is
   made "current". This control argument is useful with the read_mail
   apply request.
     apply del ERROR_LIST_NAME -tr PATH

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
