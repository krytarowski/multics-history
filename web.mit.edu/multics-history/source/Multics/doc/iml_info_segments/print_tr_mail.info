01/05/81  print_tr_mail, ptrm

Syntax:  ptrm {path} {-ctl_args}


Function:  This command is intended for use with the read_mail apply request
to print a copy of a TR which has been mailed to your mailbox.  It prints a
minimal header, followed by the TR transactions IN REVERSE ORDER.  For people
who receive the full text of mailed TRs (rather than just the new parts), ptrm
presents the most-recently modified parts of the report first.  It optionally
stops between transactions to ask if the user wants to see more transactions.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the segment containing the mailed TR.  When in
   read_mail, the apply request supplies this pathname for you.


Control arguments:
-query
   asks before the next transaction if the user wants to see more transactions
   associated with the TR? (default)
-no_query
   prints all transactions (in reverse order) without questions.
-pathname path, -pn path
   provides the pathname of a segment containing the TR mail, when the
   pathname begins with a - and therefore looks like a control argument.


List of answers to the query:
yes, y
   print next transaction.  (default if just a NL is typed as the answer)
print, pr, p
   print next transaction.
no, n, quit, q
   stop printing the TR.
rest, r
   print all remaining transactions without intervening queries.
skip, s
   skip printing of this transaction, but ask about printing subsequent
   transactions.
titles, title
   print titles for transactions which follow.  The title is the first line in
   the header of each transaction.
top
   start printing TR over again from the top.  This is useful on video
   terminals when the heading has scrolled off the screen.
?  
   print list of allowed responses.
.. COMMAND_LINE
   escape command line to Multics command processor.


Examples:
In read_mail, to apply ptrm to the 10th letter in your mailbox, type:

   apply 10 ptrm

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
