09/21/87  process_trouble_report, ptr

Syntax:  ptr {-control_args}


Function: this command processes new trouble reports, and added
information for existing trouble reports, by processing mailed
transactions from the new_reports.mbx.  These incoming transactions
must be loaded into the TR Input Queue by the trouble.absin job
before ptr is invoked.


Control arguments:
-abbrev, -ab
   enables abbreviation expansion and editing of request lines.
-no_abbrev, -nab
   disables abbreviation expansion and editing of request lines.
-profile PATH, -pf PATH
   specifies the pathname of the profile to use for abbreviation
   expansion.  The suffix "profile" is added if necessary.  This
   control argument implies -abbrev.


-prompt STR
   changes the prompt for tr_query request lines to STR.  If STR is
   "", the user is not prompted.  -prompt accepts "STR^[(^d)^]:  "
   which takes the form STR(N):, where N is the recursion level if
   greater than one.  The default prompt is "tr_query(N):  ", where N
   is the recursion level if greater than one. 
-no_prompt
   stops prompting for tr_query requests.  Equivalent to -prompt "".


-request STR, -rq STR
   specifies an initial request line to be executed prior to entering
   the request loop.  For example:

      -request "select submitter=Grey; print; quit"
-quit
   stops execution after processing the requests given with the
   -request control argument.
-request_loop, -rql
   enters the request loop after processing any requests given in the
   -request control argument.  This is the default.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
