07/27/87  laser_printer

Function:  the laser_printer request type allows users to use the
enter_output_request (eor) command to queue segments to be printed
on the Honeywell laser printer.

Note that the laser printer uses *expensive* photocopy paper, and
should be restricted to documents requiring "pretty" typeface.
Also, note that the paper hopper is relatively small, and users
should check their jobs while printing to ensure that things don't
back up because the printer has run out of paper.


Syntax:  eor PATH(S) -rqt laser_printer {-control_args}


Arguments:
PATH(S)
   is one or more segments to be laser printed
-control_args
   are any eor control arguments desired.


Notes on special formats:  the laser printer allows various page
formats and character fonts.  Certain ones are available via control
line request, and others require controls to be embedded in the file.
The default is portrait mode, with the Courier-10 font.  To get a
printout using other modes, the "-forms MODESTRING" control argument
is used.


List of special formats:

pica, courier
   use of "-forms pica", or "-forms courier" will result in the segment
   being printed in portrait mode using the Courier-10 font.

elite, prestige
   use of "-forms elite", or "-forms prestige" will result in the
   segment being printed in portrait mode using the Elite-12 font.

elite_8lpi, e8lpi
   use of "-forms elite_8lpi" or "-forms e8lpi" will result in the
   segment being printed in portrait mode using the Elite-12 font at
   8 lines per inch vertical pitch.  This results in an 88 line page,
   instead of the normal 66.


landscape
   use of "-forms landscape" will result in the segment being printed
   in landscape mode using the Gothic-15 font.

control
   use of "-forms control" will result in the printer software using
   control codes from the input segment.  The initial format is the
   default portrait/Courier-10 format.  This is the only format that
   allows controls to be embedded in the segment.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
