02/22/84 ACTC System.

02/22/84 IMFT:

IMFT has been enabled for file transfers between the MU and ACTC
Systems.  For further information, please see the related info
segments (lh imft).

Note:  The control argument "-source" cannot be used until the
       MU System has installed Multics Software Release 10.2.


01/31/84 Differences between the ACTC and MU systems:

The ACTC system is very similar to System M, and as such, does
not contain any of the MU System enhancements.  As a result, some
ACTC commands may differ slightly from the MU commands.  For
example, "qxr foo" is a valid MU command; however to achieve the
equivalent on the ACTC System, "qx <CR> r foo" must be entered, or
qx -pn which is equal to qxr.


ACTC projects:

The following projects have been set up:
     ASPD
     Fortran
     Multics
     Office
     Operator
     OperDevel
     HFED
     HIS
     SysMaint

Multics is the default project for developers, while ASPD is a 
temporary project.  The latter is to be used by developers for
file transfers between the ACTC and MU systems.  


Dialing out from the ACTC system to the MU system:

use:
   dial_out e.h016.* *2


Dialing out to system M after dialing into system MU from ACTC:

use:
   rhf sysmx25 -ftf		(-ftf for file transfer)


Dialing out to system M direct from ACTC:

 use:
    dial_out e.h024.* *13106:p25 	(modes are enabled)


File transfers:

Each individual will be responsible for transferring his/her own
segments from the MU System to the ACTC System.  

To transfer files from the MU System to the ACTC System:
   1.  Connect to the MU System using the dial_out command (above)
   2.  Invoke the file transfer facility:
         !e ec >udd>ft>to>run_ftf [switch_name]
   3.  Transfer your files:
         fetch foo


File transfer to system M:

   !ab
   !phxftf	where phxftf is an abbrev in your actc profile; eg: follows
		ec >udd>ft>to>run_ftf [switch_name] >udd>cg>ftf>ftf_slave


Printers:
						
The ACTC System will eventually have three printers.  Two of these, 
Actc1 and Actc2, are located in the Foothills Professional building.
Actc1 has been connected to the ACTC System.  Actc2 will be moved 
from MU to ACTC at a later date.  The third printer, actc, is located 
in Dispatch.  It is to serve mainly as a systems and special forms printer.
i.e. 8-1/2 x 11 forms.


Tapes:

All NEW tapes must be registered on both systems, ACTC and MU, through
the tape librarian.  If you encounter any problems with tapes that were
registered prior to the cold boot, please contact SysMaint personnel.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
