09/10/81  Multics Error Lists

There are two types of error lists available on System M,
".status.info" segments and display_error_list-style (del) error lists.
System_M error lists will gradually be converted from the status.info
segments to a new "Multics Standard Error List" format, which can be
handled by the display_error_list command.


del error lists: 
To list the names of display_error_list-style error lists, the
list_error_lists (lel) command is available.  For more information,
type:
   help lel


Two commands support del-style error lists.  display_error_list (del)
may be used to interrogate these error lists.  For more information,
type:
   help del


The edit_error_list (eel) command may be used to create and maintain
these standard error lists.  For more information, type:
   help eel


status.info error lists:
To list the names of the ".status.info" error lists, type:
   list_help .status

The help command may then be used to display the contents of these
error list info segments.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
