                    TYMNET DATA COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK

Modified on Wednesday August 16, 1978


I.   GENERAL INFO
     Honeywell subscribes to the communications service offered by TYMNET
     Corp. that allows dialing a local number in most major cities in the
     U.S., as well as some overseas locations, and by giving the proper
     id and password, being connected to the Multics system in Phoenix.
     While there is an hourly charge for this communications network ser-
     vice, it is usually less costly than either dialing direct or using
     HVN.

II.  TERMINAL TYPES

    Only 300 and 134.5 baud lines are available on Multics for access
    through the TYMNET network.

    1.TYMNET supports a wide variety of terminal types. Each terminal type
      has an identifying character which _m_u_s_t be sent to TYMNET when you
      first log in to establish the transmission characteristics of the
      terminal.



    TERMINAL IDENTIFIERS ARE:

IDENTIFIER         CODE           SPEED            TERMINAL TYPE
======================================================================
    a             ASCII       30cps, 120cps        a)CRT's with no line
                                                     feed or CR delay,
                                                   b)terminals with buffers.
    b             ASCII           15cps            all terminals.
    c             ASCII           30cps            impact printers.
    d             ASCII           10cps            all terminals.
    e             ASCII           30cps            thermal printers.
    f             ASCII       15cps input          (BETA)
    g             ASCII       30cps, 120cps        belt printers (GE
                                                   Terminet)
    i             ASCII       30cps, 120cps        matrix printers.
    p CR          EBCD/           14.8cps          (2741).
                Correspondence

III. LOGGING IN TO TYMNET

    1. Turn on the terminal and coupler.

    2. If the terminal has adjustable data transmission speeds, set the
       terminal to 30 cps. This is to handle TYMNET's initial message.
       Lower settings give a garbled message during login.

    3. If you are using a terminal that has an Auto Linefeed switch
       (such as the TermiNet 300), turn it off during the initial login
       procedure with TYMNET. Once you have made contact with Multics
       you may turn it back on.

    4. Dial the TYMNET phone number and wait for the high-pitched tone.
       (If the tone sounds weak or raspy, hang up and re-dial to obtain
       a better line).

    5. Place the telephone handset in the coupler or depress the "DATA"
       button if using a 103A or 113A dataset.

    6. The following message will be sent to your terminal at 10 cps:
       PLEASE TYPE YOUR TERMINAL IDENTIFIER

    7. Set your terminal to the desired speed (if necessary), and type
       your terminal identifying character according to the table above.

    8. TYMNET will then send:
       -XXXX-YY--
       PLEASE LOG IN:
       where: XXXX is the remote access node number,
       and YY is the port on the node to which your terminal is connected.

    9. (OPTIONAL) You may check for the presence of the network supervisor
       (which controls the Tymsat you have called) by typing a single CR.
       If the supervisor is in control, the following prompt will appear:
       USER NAME:

   10. You may need the following control characters _b_e_f_o_r_e entering your
       user name:
                a) control-H    notifies TYMNET not to echo characters
                b) control-X   to be used if you plan to input data from
                               paper tape, cassette tape, or any other
                               non-keyboard device. TYMNET must be able to
                               start and stop data entry.For this,
                               control-Q starts the device and control-S
                               stops the device.
                c) control-P   to be used if your terminal can only accept
                               even parity.

   11. After receiving "PLEASE LOG IN:" or "USER NAME:" enter your
       TYMNET user id (preceded by control characters if necessary).
       followed by a CR. (user id may be in upper OR lower case).

   12. TYMNET will then prompt you for your password:
       PASSWORD:

   13. Respond by typing your password(in upper or lower case), followed by a CR.
       N_O_T_E_: If you want to eliminate the prompt "PASSWORD:", enter your
             TYMNET user id, a semi-colon(;), and the password followed
             by a CR.(THIS MAY NOT WORK FOR NON-ASCII TERMINALS)

   14. You should then receive either a semi-colon(;) or the following:
       P nn (which indicates the port number of the TYCOM connected to Multics)
       HOST IS ONLINE

   15. From here on, the login procedure is exactly as if you were dialing
       directly into Multics.

   16. When you logout from Multics, TYMNET will respond:
       CP DISCONNECTS  DROPPED BY HOST SYSTEM
       PLEASE LOGIN: (at this point you may hang up the phone)


IV. TYMNET Problem Responses


    1. ALL PORTS BUSY        All available Multics TYMNET ports are in use
                             at the transmission speed you have requested.
                             Try again later or try another transmission
                             speed.

    2. BUSY TONE             If received when dialing the TYMNET network,
                             wait a few minutes and try again. If the busy
                             tone persists, call your local telephone repair
                             service to check if the local lines are truly
                             busy or out of service. If lines are continously
                             busy, but not out of service, notify the Multics
                             Computer Center.

     3. HOST DOWN            Indicates the Multics system is not in operation.
                             Wait and try later or contact the Multics
                             Computer Center.

    4. SYSTEM ERROR ON PORTn System is operational but a specific port
                             or channel is not answering. Notify the Multics
                             Computer Center.

    5. HOST NOT AVAILABLE THROUGH NET
                             1)The TYMCOM is down, or 2)invalid host requested,
                             or 3)a new supervisor is taking over the net and
                             has not picked up the host yet.

    6. HOST NOT RESPONDING   The link between the TYMCOM and the host is
                             temporarily lost. Try again in a few minutes.

    7. To report trouble call the Multics Computer Center - (602)249-7567
        or HVN  341-7567.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
