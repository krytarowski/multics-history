06/30/88  list_tr_topic, ltrt


Syntax as a command:  ltrt {topic}


Function: displays known areas of the Multics system for which TRs
have been reported.  The list contains the name of any matching topics
and the command TR development identification and error list name where
problem reports are entered.


Arguments:
topic
   A string to be searched for in the TR system topics catalog.  A
   regular expression may be used in specifying a topic.


Notes on TRs and error lists:
The online Multics error lists are named to match generic TR
identifiers.  To locate available information for a problem
first locate the TR identifier and error list name using this command.


Notes on finding a TR by topic:
To locate TRs related to a specific topic, use the tr_query (trq)
command.  Select using the string:

 ! trq
   tr_query: ! sl to = TR_EL_ID

where TR_EL_ID is the value listed by the ltrt command.  Once selected,
select again using the string:

tr_query: ! sl area = TOPIC -inter

where TOPIC is the specific topic that is needed.  Finish by listing
and printing specific TRs of interest and then exit the trq command
subsystem.


Notes on finding an error list entry by topic:
To locate error list entries related to a specific topic, use the
display_error_list (del) command.  Select the error list by entering:

 ! del TR_EL_ID

where TR_EL_ID is the value listed by the ltrt command.  Select entries
related to the needed topic by entering:

   del: ! sl "module contains TOPIC or desc contains TOPIC"

finish by printing the error list numbers that are returned and then
exit the del command subsystem.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
