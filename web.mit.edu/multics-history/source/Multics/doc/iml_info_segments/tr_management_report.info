:Info: tr_management_report: trmr: 03/15/88 tr_management_report

Syntax:  trmr {-control_args}


Function: produces a report on the performance of selected MSD
personnel in meeting TR processing goals.  The report includes
performance statistics, plus a summary of outstanding TRs.  This
command is restricted to use by developers only.


Control arguments:
-output_file path, -of path
   puts the report into the file specified by path.  (default: put
   report into tr_report file in working directory).
-release R, -rl R
   specifies the Multics software release period identification R to be
   used as a reference for calculating and reporting TR processing
   statistics and TR summaries.  See "Notes on reporting period
   selection" below for more details.


-from D, -fm D
   specifies the beginning of the period to be reported on.  Only TRs
   entered on or after the date D are included in the report.
   (default: all TRs in the TR database are included).
-to D
   specifies the end of the period to be reported on.  Only TRs entered
   on or before date D are included in the report.  (default: consider
   TRs entered up to the current point in time).
-name Person_id, -nm Person_id
   report statistics only for the named individual, for people who work
   for him, and for his managers.  (default: use Person_id of current
   user, unless -all is given).


-individual_contributor, -ic
   when a manager's name is given with -name, then report statistics
   for the manager as an individual contributor, rather than statistics
   for his entire unit.  If the summary of TRs is to be printed, then
   report on TRs assigned for the person specified only.
-individual_contributor_summary, -ics
   If the summary of TRs is to be printed, then report on TRs assigned
   for the person specified only.


-all, -a
   report on the TR performance of all people in tr_dev_table_.  This
   table should include all people to whom TRs have been assigned.
-depth N, -dh N
   when -all is given, report statistics for first N levels of the
   management hierarchy.  (default: all levels of management
   hierarchy).

   When -all is not given, report statistics for the named individual,
   all managers above the individual and for N levels below that
   individual.  (default: 1).


-origin O, -orig O
   reports on TRs entered internal to HIS, or external
   customer-generated TRs.  O can be:
      external, ext, e
      internal, int, i

   (default: report on both internal and external TRs).


-summary {T} {P},
-sm {T} {P}
   includes a summary of TRs assigned to individual contributors listed
   in the statistics.  T is an optional TR type, and P is an optional
   problem priority.  These options control the type and priority of
   TRs listed in the summary.  (default: include all TRs for the
   individual contributor in the summary).


   T can be:
      problem, prob, prb, pb, p
      question, ques, qs, q
      suggestion, sugg, sg, s
   The type may be preceded by ^ to have the given type excluded.
   (default: provide summary information for problems, questions and
   suggestions).


   P is an optional priority constraint applied to problems.  It may
   have a value of:
      critical, c
      high, h
      normal, n
   The priority may be preceded by ^ to have the given priority
   excluded.  See examples below.  (default: all priorities).


-no_summary
   suppresses creation of the summary.
-retain, -ret
   Use a stored computed statistics in generating the report. See
   "Notes on retained statistics" below for more detail.
-no_retain, -nret
   don't use stored computed statistics in generating the report.
   (default).


Notes on reporting period selection:
   A reporting period is a Multics software release development period.
   The dates which denote each release period are established in the
   tr_dev_table_.

   To display the releases, their dates and the default release period,
   use the display_tr_dev_table -goals command.  To select a release
   other than the default release, the -release control argument is
   used.

   Once a release period is established for reporting, the program will
   calculate performance with regard to TRs within the period.  All TRs
   entered before or during the selected release are counted.  Any TRs
   entered after the entry period of the release will not be reported
   on.


Notes on retained statistics:
   The calculation of TR processing statistics is a relatively slow
   operation.  When the trmr program is going to be run many times in
   succession such as is done when the statistics are reported for each
   developer in MDC, the -retain control can be very useful in speeding
   up processing time.

   This will cause the program to search a database for statistics that
   have already been calculated and add them to the TR report.  Any
   missing statistics are calculated and added to both the TR report
   and the database.

   The database segment is located in the working directory where the
   trmr program is being run.  The naming convention of the file is
   R.trmr_data where R is the Multics software release identification
   specified by -release R.


Access required:  access to read the TR data base.


List of examples:

trmr
   generates a report for the current user, and stores the report in
   the tr_report segment in the working directory.  The report contains
   statistics for internal and external TRs of all types, and summaries
   of TRs assigned to each individual contributor listed in the
   statistics.  The report includes only TRs entered during the current
   goaling period for TRs.

trmr -a -tp p -orig e -no_summary
   generates a report giving TR processing statistics for external
   problem TRs for all people named in tr_dev_table_.

trmr -name MDC_unit_mgr -ic
   generates a report giving TR processing statistics and summary
   information for MDC_unit_mgr as an individual contributor.
   Statistics and summary include all TRs in the TR DB.

trmr -name MDC_unit_mgr -depth 2 -sm ^s ^n
   generates a report for MDC_unit_mgr as a manager, with a summary
   which includes only critical and high priority problems, plus
   questions (ie, normal problems and suggestions are excluded).


:Info: tr_developer_summary: trds: 03/15/88 tr_developer_summary


Syntax:  trds {-control_arg}


Function: produces a summary of outstanding reports assigned to a
particular developer.  This command is restricted to use by developers
only.


Control arguments:
-output_file path, -of path
   puts the report into the file specified by path.  (default: put
   report into tr_summary file in working directory).
-release R, -rl R
   specifies the Multics software release period identification R to be
   used as a reference for calculating and reporting TR processing
   statistics and TR summaries.  See "Notes on reporting period
   selection" below for more details.  (default: established by
   tr_dev_table_).


-from D, -fm D
   specifies the beginning of the period to be reported on.  Only TRs
   entered on or after the date D are included in the summary.
   (default: start with earliest TR in TR data base).
-to D
   specifies the end of the period to be reported on.  Only TRs entered
   on or before date D are included in the summary.  (default: consider
   TRs entered up to the current point in time).


-name Person_id, -nm Person_id
   provide summary for the named individual.  (default: use Person_id
   of current user).
-individual_contributor, -ic
   when a manager's name is given with -name, then report summaries for
   the manager as an individual contributor, rather than for his entire
   unit.
-individual_contributor_summary, -ics
   If the summary of TRs is to be printed, then report on TRs assigned
   for the person specified only.
-depth N, -dh N
   Report summary of each TR for the named individual, and for N levels
   below that individual.  (default: 1).


-origin O, -orig O
   reports on TRs entered internal to HIS, or external
   customer-generated TRs.  O can be:
      external, ext, e
      internal, int, i
   (default: report on both internal and external TRs).


-type T {P}, -tp T {P}
   reports on TRs of type T.  T can be:
      problem, prob, prb, pb, p
      question, ques, qs, q
      suggestion, sugg, sg, s
   The type may be preceded by ^ to have the given type excluded.
   (default: provide summary information for problems, questions and
   suggestions).

   P is an optional priority constraint applied to problems.  It may
   have a value of:
      critical, c
      high, h
      normal, n
   The priority may be preceded by ^ to have the given priority
   excluded.  See examples below.  (default: all priorities).


Notes on reporting period selection:
   The reporting period for TR statistics and summaries is set up in
   two ways.  First, using the -from and -to controls, the range of TRs
   available for reporting on is established.  Usually this is done
   automatically using the defaults.  Second, the reference or focus of
   the report is established.

   The focus of the report is basically a way to format the summaries
   in relation to a Multics software release for which TR processing
   goals have been set.  TR summaries will be printed for all
   unresolved TRs for the selected person grouped into those applying
   to the release processing period and those that are POST release.

   Finally, the release identity may be established by use of the
   -release control argument or by defaulting to the value established
   in the tr_dev_table_.


Access required:  access to read the TR data base.


List of examples:
trds -type ^suggestion ^normal
   provides a summary of critical and high priority problems, and of
   questions.

trds -tp p ^n
   provides a summary of critical and high priority problems.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
