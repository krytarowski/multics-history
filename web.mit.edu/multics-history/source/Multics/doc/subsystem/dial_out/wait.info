12/12/91  dial_out request:  wait

Syntax:  !wait {STR} {-control_args}

Syntax as an active request:  [wait {STR} {-control_args}]

Function:
Causes dial_out to wait until a specified string is sent from the
foreign system.  As an active request, wait will return all characters
sent from the foreign system, including the string specified, since
the last characters processed by dial_out.


Arguments:
STR
   the string that must be sent from the foreign system.  If omitted,
   dial_out will wait until any characters are sent from the foreign
   system unless -nl is supplied.


Control arguments:
-inhibit_error, -ihe
   specifies that dial_out should not abort after a timeout has
   occured. This control argument requires that a timeout interval
   greater than zero also be specified (See the '-timeout' ctl arg).
   This control argument is most useful when wait is used as an active
   request.
-nl
   specifies that dial_out should wait for an occurence of the
   specified string that ends in a new line (octal 12).
-nnl
   undoes -nl.
-no_inhibit_error, -nihe
   Specifies that timeouts should result in an abort.  This is the
   default.


-no_timeout, -ntm
   specifies no time out.  This is the default.
-timeout N, -tm N
   specifies the maximum time, in seconds, that can elapse between
   transmissions of characters from the foreign system before dial_out
   is to assume that the transmission is complete and that the wait
   should terminate.


Notes:
  This request is intended for dial_out exec_coms that attempt to enter
a conversation with a foreign system.  As such, it allows for some
degree of synchronization with the foreign system.

  Within dial_out exec_coms, when used as an active request, wait will
return all characters sent since the last wait request or active
request.  When not in an exec_com, wait returns all characters sent
since the last characters printed by normal processing.

  The other suggested use is:
     'e fo FILE; wait STR; e ro'
which allows for receipt of a foreign file where the user does not
watch the transmission (as in the dial_out file_output request) but
instead specifies a string that marks the end of transmission.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
