01/24/82  Standard subsystem request:  list_help, lh

Syntax:  lh {topics}


Function:  displays the names of all subsystem info segments pertaining
to a given set of topics.


Arguments:
topics
   specifies the topics of interest.  Any subsystem info segment which
   contains one of these topics as a substring is listed.


Notes:
If no topics are given, all info segments available for the subsystem
are listed.

When matching topics with info segment names, an info segment name is
considered to match a topic only if that topic is at the beginning or
end of a word within the segment name.  Words in info segment names are
bounded by the beginning and end of the segment name and by the
characters period (.), hyphen (-), underscore (_), and dollar sign ($).
The ".info" suffix is not considered when matching topics.


Examples:
The request line:
   list_help list
will match info segments named list, list_users, and forum_list but
will not match an info segment named prelisting.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
