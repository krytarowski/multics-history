06/12/87  read_record, rdrec

Syntax:  read_record {-count N}, rdrec {-ct N}


Function:  reads the current record into a temporary buffer.
If the tape is one of the five known standard labeled tapes,
the record is checked to determine if it is a label or trailer
record; if it is, information pertinent to that particular
record type is displayed.  Otherwise, information pertaining
to the physical record length in bits, words, 8-bit bytes,
9-bit bytes, and 6-bit characters is displayed.  When the
-count argument is specified, N records are read, overlaying
each other in the temporary buffer.  Note that when read_record
encounters a tape mark, it leaves you positioned at the
beginning of the next file.


Control Argument:
-count N, -ct N
   When the -count argument is specified, N records are read,
   overlaying each other in the temporary buffer.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
