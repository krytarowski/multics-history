Syntax: dump {offset} {n_words} {char_types}


Function:  displays the contents of the record buffer (filled
with the read_record request) on the users terminal.  If no
arguments are specified, the contents of the entire tape buffer
are displayed in octal format.  If the n_words argument is
specified, it must follow offset.  However, these arguments may
be positioned before or after any char_type arguments that may
be specified.  The offset and n_words arguments must be specified
in octal.  If offset is specified without being followed by
n_words, then the tape buffer is dumped starting with the
<offset>th word and ending with the last word in the tape buffer.


The char_type optional arguments allow interpretation of the data
contained in the tape buffer in various character formats.  If
more than one char_type argument is specified, then the tape
buffer is dumped with the first character interpretation,
followed by the next character interpretation, and so on until
all requested data formats have been dumped.  The value of
char_type can be selected from the following:

   -ascii
      displays the contents of the record buffer in octal with an
      ASCII interpretation of the data on the right side.

   -bcd
      displays the contents of the record buffer in octal with a BCD
      interpretation of the data on the right side


   -ebcdic
      displays the contents of the record buffer in octal with an
      EBCDIC interpretation of the data on the right side.

   -hex
      displays the record buffer in hexadecimal format.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
