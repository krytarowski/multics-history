02/21/85  startup, star

Syntax as a command:  star


Function:  causes all logical volumes that were mounted at the time of
the last shutdown to be automatically mounted.  It also initializes the
answering service.  This command is usually the first thing you type
when you are bringing up Multics for a normal user session.  This
command can be used in ring 1 or ring 4.

All parts of the system_start_up.ec are executed in response to the
startup command.  Part 1 (those commands executed before the answering
service is started) is executed before answering service
initialization.  Part 2 (those commands executed after the answering
service is ready but before logins are accepted) is then executed; then
all terminal channels are instructed to answer.  After the terminal
channels have been started, part 3 (those commands executed after the
telephone lines are answered) is executed.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
