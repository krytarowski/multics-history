02/18/85 reregister

Syntax as a command:  reregister volume_name drive_name


Function:  regenerates volume registration information.  This command
can be used in ring 1 only.


Arguments:
volume_name
   is the name of a physical volume.
drive_name
   has the form <subsys>_<nn>, e.g., dska_02.


Notes:  This command reads the label of the volume on the specified
drive name.  If it is a valid label for the volume whose name is given,
the registration data is refabricated from the label and the drive is
left in the known state.

This command should only be used to re-create logical volume
registration information if it has been lost because of a system crash
or other mishap.


The reregister command can re-create the logical volume registration,
physical volume registration, master directory control segment, and the
link to the access control segment.  If the registration data was
damaged, the system administrator should be informed so that he can run
the register_mdir command or correct any errors in the volume
registration.

Volumes that are accepted by bootload (the volumes listed on the root
config card) are registered automatically and cannot be registered
manually.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
