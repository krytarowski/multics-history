02/14/85  multics, mult

Syntax as a command:  mult


Function:  initializes the answering service but does not accept
logins.  It is the first half of a startup.  A random login word is
made up, which the users must use to log in on this special session.
This command can be used in ring 1 or ring 4.


Notes:  Typing the multics command initializes the answering service
and generates a random login word.  To cause the lines to answer, type
go.  To revert to a normal session, use the word command.  Part one of
the system_start_up.ec is executed before the answering service is
initialized.

When this command is issued in ring 1, it causes the entire RLV to be
mounted, if not already accepted (when issued in ring 4, the RLV is
already accepted).

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
