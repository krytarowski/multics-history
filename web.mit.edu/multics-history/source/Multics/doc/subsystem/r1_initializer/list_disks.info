08/27/86  list_disks, ld

Syntax as a command:  ld {drive_name} {-control_args}


Function: lists the usage of storage system disk drives and all pending
add_lv commands.  You can use it in ring 1 or 4.


Arguments:
drive_name
   is the name of a drive to be listed.  If you give no drive_name, all
   drives configured on the system are listed.


Control arguments:
-lv lvname
   list only drives pertaining to lvname.
-pv pvname
   list only drives pertaining to pvname.
-brief, -bf
   list only nonempty drives.
-mounts, -mt
   list only pending ad_lv commands.


Notes: If a physical volume is listed with the logical volume name in
parentheses and one star at the end of the line, that volume is assumed
to be present, as a result of a previous bootload, demount, or
outstanding add_lv.  The system has not read the volume label, but does
so in response to an add_vol command.

If a physical volume is listed with the logical volume name in
parentheses and three stars at the end of the line, that volume is
known; its label has been read by an add_vol command.  You must issue
an add_lv command to place the volume in use.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
