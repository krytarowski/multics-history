12/03/86  load_from_diskette, lfd

Syntax as a command:  lfd {-mca mca_id} {diskette_type1.....N or -all}
   {-control_args}


Function:  loads MCA diskettes into a tandd_deck_file.  See "notes on
diskettes" below.


Arguments:
-mca <mca_id>
   specifies the MCA to be used for reading diskettes.  Where <mca_id>
   is a value between a-d and is equal to the designation of the IMU.
diskette_type1...N
   label(s) of diskette(s) to be read.


Control arguments:
-all -a
   load all know MCA diskettes into the tandd_deck_file.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses messages from deckfile_manager specifing the
   deckfile.list and tandd_deck_file that will be used for this
   request.
-deckfile deckfile_path, -df deckfile_path
   specifies that the deckfile_path is the target tandd_deck_file to be
   used for this request.


Notes:  If a required argument or information is missing the user is
queried for the required information.



Notes on deckfile_path:  If the deckfile_path is not given on the
request line then the following sequence is used.  If a deckfile_path
is entered in the deckfile_manager command line, it is used.  Otherwise
the current working_dir is searched for an entry, if one is found the
user is notified of its use.  If an entry is not found and the user has
sufficient effective access, the user is queried as to the creation of
the tandd_deck_file or deckfile.list.  If the reply is no and the user
has sufficient effective access to modify the tandd_deck_file in
>system_library_tandd, the user is again query as to its usage.  If no
tandd_deck_file is found the command is aborted.



Notes on diskettes:  A list of required diskettes or -all (-a) may be
requested.  A list of known valid diskettes may be obtained by the
list_diskette_types (ldt) request.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
