12/2/84  forum request:  reply, rp

Syntax:  rp {transaction_specifier} {-control_args}


Function:
Allows a participant to build, and optionally enter into the a meeting,
a transaction which is in reply to an earlier transaction.


Arguments:
transaction_specifier
   is the transaction specifier of the transaction to be replied to.
   If this argument is not given, the current transaction is replied
   to.  Transaction specifier must name only one transaction, and
   therefore may not include a user_id, regular expression, or range.


Control arguments:
-auto_write
   Do not require the "w" request to be given in the editor
   in order to save editing changes. This is only meaningful
   if the transaction is entered from the terminal and ended
   with \f.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses printing of the message indicating that the transaction
   was successfully entered.


-fill, -fi
   specifies that the transaction should be filled after the user has
   exited input mode. This is the default, unless the -input_file
   control argument is used or unless the -no_input_fill (-nif)
   control argument was given with the invocation of forum.  The
   default fill width is 72, but the user can specify the fill width
   -via the line_length control argument or either the -line_length
   or -input_line_length control arguments to the forum command.
-force, -fc
   overwrites a previous unprocessed transaction without querying.
-input_file pathname, -if pathname
   specifies that the segment named by pathname be entered into the
   meeting. The default is to read the transaction from the terminal.


-line_length LENGTH, -ll LENGTH
   fills the transaction to the specified line length.  The default
   is 72 columns unless a different value was given with the
   -input_line_length or -line_length control arguments to the forum
   command.
-long, -lg
   print a message indicating that the transaction was successfully
   entered. (Default).
-meeting meeting_name, -mtg meeting_name
   enters the transaction into the meeting_name meeting. The default
   is to enter the transaction into the proceedings of the meeting
   the user is currently attending. meeting_name may be a meeting name
   or a pathname.


-no_auto_write
   Require the "w" request to be given in the editor
   in order to save editing changes. This is only meaningful
   if the transaction is entered from the terminal and ended
   with \f.  (Default)
-no_fill, -nfi
   specifies that the transaction not be filled to the default fill
   width when entered.  The default is to fill the transaction, unless
   the -input_file control argument is specified or the -no_input_fill
   argument was given with the invocation of forum.  The default fill
   width is 72, but the user can specify the fill width via the
   -line_length control argument or either the -line_length
   or -input_line_length control arguments to the forum command.


-no_force, -nfc
   query before overwriting a previous unprocessed transaction.
-no_request_loop, -nrql
   causes the transaction to be entered into the meeting without first
   entering the forum request loop. (Default unless -if is given)
-request_loop, -rql
   causes the forum request loop to be entered before the transaction
   is entered in the meeting. (Default if -if is given)
-subject subject_string, -sj subject_string
   Specifies that subject_string be used as the subject, avoiding the
   prompt for subject. The default is to use the subject of the
   transaction being replied to. If subject_string contains whitespace,
   it must be quoted.
-terminal_input, -ti
   Specifies that the transaction be input from the user's terminal.
   (Default)


Notes on terminal input:
Unless the user makes use of the -input_file control argument, the
transaction will be built by taking lines from the user's terminal.
There are three methods of exiting from terminal input mode -  line
consisting of the single character period (.)

Enters the transaction as is, returns to forum request level.
\f
   exits terminal input mode and invokes 'qedx' editor on transaction.
\q or \fq
   exits terminal input mode and enters forum request loop.


Notes:
A transaction which was not entered via the period (.) exit from
terminal input mode may be entered from forum request level via the
'enter' request.  Type 'help enter' from forum request level for
details.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
