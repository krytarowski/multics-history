8/6/83  forum request:  ted

Syntax:  ted {-control_args}


Function:
Invokes the "ted" editor to edit the text of the unprocessed transaction or
to build a new transaction.


Control arguments:
-auto_write
   specifies that the "w" request is not required in order to
   save editing changes.  See "Notes".
-fill, -fi
   specifies that the transaction is to be refilled upon exit from
   the editor. This is the default unless the -no_input_fill control
   argument was given to the forum command or unless the -no_fill
   control argument was given to the talk or reply request.
-no_auto_write
   specifies that the "w" request is required in order to
   save editing changes.  See "Notes".  (Default)
-no_fill, -nfi
   specifies that the transaction is not to be refiled upon exit from
   the editor.


Notes:  If -auto_write is not specified, then the write (w) request must
be used to reflect any changes made to the transaction back to forum.
The write request may be used as often as desired to checkpoint the
editing process.

If the quit (q) request is issued and the transaction has been modified
since it was last written, ted will query for permission to exit.  If
permission is given, any changes made since the last write request (if
any) will be lost.


If issued before use of the write request, the request line
     1,$dr
will restore the original transaction text to the buffer.  If given
after a write request, this request line will restore the transaction
as saved by the last write request given in the buffer.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
