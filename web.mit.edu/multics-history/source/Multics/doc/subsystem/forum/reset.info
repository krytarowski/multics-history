10/20/82  forum request:  reset, rs

Syntax:  rs {trans_spec}  {-control_arg}


Function:
Resets the user's "current" or "highest transaction seen" index to
the specified transaction number.  The "highest transaction seen"
is only maintained for pre-MR11 version meetings.  For current version
meetings, seen switches should be used.  Type "help switch_on" or
"help switch_off" for more information.

Argument:
trans_specs
   is a transaction specifier which determines the value of the transaction
   number that the index will be reset to.  Only one transaction specifier
   may be given.  Type "help trans_specs" for information on transaction
   specifiers.


Control arguments:
-current
   sets the current transaction index to be the specified transaction.
   (Default)
-highest
   sets the highest seen transaction index to the specified transaction.
   This control argument only applies to pre-MR11 version meetings.


-new
   makes the specified transaction the first "new" transaction. This is
   equivalent to "reset -highest trans_num-1".  This control argument
   only applies to pre-MR11 version meetings.
-next
   makes the specified transaction the "next" transaction. This is the
   same as "reset trans_num-1".


Notes: 

The "current transaction index" is a logical pointer to a transaction in a
meeting.  Many forum requests, including print and write, use the value of
this index if no transaction specifiers are supplied.  It is initially set to
the value of the"non_deleted last_seen transaction" when the user enters a
meeting.  The "non_deleted last_seen transaction" index is a logical pointer
to the non_delete highest numbered transaction that the user has listed,
printed or written to a segment.  This index is used when detemining which
transactions are 'new'.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
