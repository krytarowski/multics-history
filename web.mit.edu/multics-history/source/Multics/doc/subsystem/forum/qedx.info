8/6/83  forum request:  qedx, qx

Syntax:  qx {-control_arguments}


Function:
Invokes the Multics qedx editor to edit the text of the unprocessed
transaction or to build a new transaction.


Control arguments:
-auto_write
   specifies that the "w" request is not required in order to
   save editing changes.  See "Notes".
-fill, -fi
   specifies that the transaction is to be refilled upon exit from
   the editor. This is the default unless the -no_input_fill control
   argument was given to the forum command or unless the -no_fill
   control argument was given to the talk or reply request.
-no_fill, -nfi
   specifies that the transaction is not to be refilled upon exit from
   the editor.
-no_auto_write
   specifies that the "w" request is required in order to
   save editing changes.  See "Notes".  (Default)


Notes:
The transaction text is placed in buffer 0.  The write (w) request must
be used to reflect any changes made to the transaction back to forum
unless -auto_write is given.  If -auto_write is given, the contents of
buffer 0 always replaces the transaction when the editor is exited.
The write request may be used as often as desired to checkpoint the
editing process.

If the quit (q) request is issued, -auto_write was not specified, and
the transaction has been modified since it was last written, qedx will
query for permission to exit.  If permission is given, any changes made
since the last write request (if any) will be lost.  The quit-force
(qf) request may be used to abort unwanted editing without being
queried.


The read (r) and write (w) requests still accept pathnames and may be
used to insert a segment into the transaction or make a copy in a segment
for later use, respectively.  However, when used with a pathname, these
requests will no longer change the default pathname for buffer 0 (the
transaction).  Using either read or write without a pathname will always
refer to forum's copy of the transaction.


If issued before use of the write request, the request line
     1,$dr
will restore the original transaction text to the buffer.  If given
after a write request, this request line will restore the transaction
as saved by the last write request given in the buffer.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
