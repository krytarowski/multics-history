03/21/85 inactive_limit

Syntax as a command:  inactive_limit {N}


Function:  allows the I/O Daemon to log out automatically after a
specified period of inactivity.


Arguments:
N
   is the number of minutes of inactivity allowed.  N may be from zero
   to 200 minutes.  Zero indicates no automatic logout; this is the
   default.  The current inactivity limit is displayed if N is not
   given.


Notes:  The inactivity time counter is reset when a request or command
is received or a quit is signalled, as well as when the driver
processes a new request.  A driver at command level is considered
active.

An inactivity logout will reinitialize a remote driver so that another
station can log in and use the line.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
