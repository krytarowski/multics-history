03/21/85 step

Syntax as a command:  step {arg}


Function:  sets (puts the driver into) or resets (takes the driver out
of) step mode.  When in step mode, the driver returns to command level
after processing each request from the coordinator.  When not in step
mode, the driver processes requests from the coordinator as soon as
received without operator interaction.  Step mode is useful for
checking the alignment of paper on the printer or other device
functions prior to allowing the driver to run continuously without
operator interaction.


Arguments:
set, reset
   to put the driver into or take the driver out of step mode.  If no
   argument is supplied, step mode is set.  The driver is not in step
   mode immediately after driver initialization.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
