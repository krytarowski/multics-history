03/21/85 ready

Syntax as a command:  ready dev1 ...  devN {-control_arg}


Function:  places the device and the specified minor devices in the
active or "ready" state.  The driver only requests service from the
coordinator for a ready device.  This command performs the reverse
function of the halt command.


Arguments:
devi
   is the name of a device, or minor device in the case of a
   multifunction device, that is to be placed in the ready state.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   to place all devices in the ready state.  If the -all control
   argument is used, no device names need be given.  If there is only
   one device, no control argument is required.  In this case, the
   ready command is executed automatically during driver
   initialization.  If there are multiple minor devices, the operator
   must specify the ones to be made ready or else must specify -all to
   make all minor devices ready.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
