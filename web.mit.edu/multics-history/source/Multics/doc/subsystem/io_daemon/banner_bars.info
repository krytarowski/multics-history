Syntax as a command:  banner_bars {minor_device} {arg}


Function:  used by printer drivers to establish how the separator bars
at the bottom of the head sheet are to be printed.  Printers that can
overstrike should use "double" (this is the default).  Other printers
should use single.


Arguments:
minor_device
   is a minor device name (as shown by the status command) and is
   required if there is more than one printer minor device; arg can be
   one of the following separator types:
   double
      overstrikes each separator line.
   single
      single strikes each separator line.
   none
      suppresses separator lines.
   -print
      if arg is not given, or if a single arg "-print", is given, the
      current value is printed.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
