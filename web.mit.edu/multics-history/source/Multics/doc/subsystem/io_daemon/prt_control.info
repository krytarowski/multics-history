03/21/85 prt_control

Syntax as a command:  prt_control {minor_device} {args}


Function:  sets the driver request processing modes.  Each key may be
preceded by the circumflex character (^) to set the value to off.


Arguments:
minor_device
   is a minor device name (as shown by the status command) This
   argument is optional if there is only one printer minor device, but
   it required otherwise.
-print
   if arg is not given, or if a single arg "-print" is given, the
   current modes are printed.


auto_print, ^auto_print
   This mode causes the driver to start printing each request as soon
   as it is received from the coordinator (after a go command has been
   given).  This is the normal mode of operation.  When ^auto_print is
   turned off, the driver goes to request command level immediately
   after printing the log message.  This allows the operator to align
   the paper, change the paper, print sample pages, and issue all other
   commands allowed at request command level (including the kill
   command).
force_esc, ^force_esc
   This mode turns on the esc mode of the printer DIM during the
   processing of each request.  This mode must be on if the
   slew-to-channel functions are to operate.  Normally, the force_esc
   mode is set by data in the request type info (rqti) segment.


force_nep, ^force_nep
   This mode sets the noendpage (nep) mode of the printer DIM during
   the processing of each request, whether the user has requested that
   mode or not.  It is normally set from data in the rqti segment.
   This mode is used for request types that require preprinted or
   preformatted paper (e.g., gummed labels, invoice forms).
force_ctl_char
   This sets the ctl_char mode of the printer DIM during the processing
   of each request, which allows an I/O daemon to send control
   sequences directly to a remote printer instead of discarding the
   characters or printing their octal equivalents.  Setting this mode
   enables users who prepare print files through Compose to activate
   special printer features such as superscripting or multiple fonts.
   This mode is honored only by the remote printer driver module,
   remote_driver_.


Notes:  If no arguments are given, the current modes are printed.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
