03/21/85 req_status

Syntax as a command:  req_status {-control_arg}


Function:  gives the operator information about the current request.
This command may only be used at request command level.


Control arguments:
-long, -lg
   for printers only.  Gives the operator the following information:

         number of multisegment file components
         number of characters in file
         current page number
         current copy number
         current line count
         current multisegment file component
         char offset in current component
         char offset from start of file
         printer DIM modes
         printer DIM position


   If the control argument is omitted, only the first four items in the
   above list are printed.  In this case, the information looks like:

         Request 10001: >print_files>invoices>Station_A.invoices
         file components:  2,   char count:  4732865
         page no:       1006    current copy no: 2

   There is no control_arg defined for punches.  The following three
   items are printed as shown below.

         current copy number
         current request number
         current pathname


   In this case, the information looks like this.

         Request 20001 >punch_files>invoices>Station_A.invoices
         current copy no:  2

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
