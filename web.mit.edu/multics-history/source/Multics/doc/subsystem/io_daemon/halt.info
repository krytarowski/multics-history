03/20/85 halt

Syntax as a command:  halt dev1 ...  devn {control_arg}


Function:  provides the reverse function of the ready command.  It
places the device or each of the specified minor devices in the
inactive state.  The driver does not ask the coordinator for any
further requests for a halted device.  However, the coordinator may
have already supplied a "pending request" for the halted device.  In
this case, any pending request is processed immediately after the
device has been halted (except when the command has been issued
following a quit signal).


Arguments:
devi
   is the name of a device, or minor device in the case of a
   multifunction device, that is to be placed in the inactive state.
   The device names that can be used are those printed out by the
   status command.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   specifies that all devices are to be halted.  If the -all control
   argument is used, no device names need be specified.  If there is
   only one device neither the device name nor -all need be specified.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
