03/21/85 paper_info

Syntax as a command:  paper_info {minor_device} {-control_args}


Function:  defines the physical characteristics of the paper as used by
the printer software.


Arguments:
minor_device
   is a minor device name (as shown by the status command) and is
   required if there is more than one printer minor device


Control arguments:
-print
   print the current values.  If this is given, it must be the only
   control arg.
-ll N
   sets the line length to N, where N is a decimal integer from 10 to
   200.
-pl N
   sets the page length to N, where N is a decimal integer from 10 to
   127.
-lpi N
   sets the number of lines per inch to N, where N is either 6 or 8.

   If no control arguments are given, the current values are printed.


Notes:  If the printer uses a firmware VFC image, a new image is loaded
(which causes the printer to go into an unsynchronized state).
Otherwise, the operator is told to mount a new VFU tape.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
