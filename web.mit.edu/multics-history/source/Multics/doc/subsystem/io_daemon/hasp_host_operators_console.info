03/20/85  hasp_host_operators_console, hhoc

Syntax as a command:  hhoc tty_channel {control_arguments}
   {attach_arguments}


Function:  is used to simulate the operation of the operator's console
of a HASP workstation.  The operator's console is used to identify a
workstation to a remote system, to issue commands governing the
operation of the workstation, and to receive status information from
the remote system.


Arguments:
tty_channel
   is the name of the terminal channel to be attached as the operator's
   console.  This channel must be configured as the console sub-channel
   of a HASP multiplexer channel (eg:  a.h014.op).  See the Multics
   Communications Administrator's Manual, Order No.  CC75, for a
   further description of the HASP multiplexer.


Control arguments:
-signon STR
   specifies that the remote host requires a SIGNON record to be
   transmitted before data transmission may occur.  STR is the text of
   the control record; it may be up to 80 characters in length.  Before
   transmission it is translated to uppercase and the remote system's
   character is set.
-no_signon
   specifies that the remote host does not require a SIGNON record.
   (Default)


attach_arguments
   are options acceptable to the hasp_host_ I/O module.  This command
   supplies the -comm, -tty, and -device options automatically; these
   options need not be given on the command line.  (See the Multics
   Subroutines and I/O Modules manual, Order No.  AG93 for a
   description of the hasp_host_ I/O module.)


Notes:  If the remote system requires a SIGNON, the -signon option
should be supplied on the command line specifying the exact SIGNON
record to be transmitted.


List of hasp_host_operators_console requests:  The following requests
are recognized by hasp_host_operators_console when given at the
beginning of a line of terminal input:
 .. <REST_OF_LINE>
   the rest of the line is passed to the Multics command processor for
   execution as ordinary commands.


 .
   prints a message of the form:

         hasp_host_operators_console N.N; connected to channel NAME.

   where N.N is the current version of this program and NAME identifies
   the channel connected as a console to the remote system.
 quit
   causes the command to hangup the operator's console channel and
   return to Multics command level.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
