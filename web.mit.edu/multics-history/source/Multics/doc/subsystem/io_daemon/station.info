03/21/85 station

Syntax as a command:  station station_id {station_password}


Function:  used by a driver to identify and validate a remote station.
This command is similar to the standard Multics login command.


Arguments:
station_id
   is the registered id of the station, as defined by the
   administrator.
station_password
   is the registered password for the remote station.


Notes:  The station's identifier and password are registered in the PNT
using the card input password as the station password and are supplied
by the administrator for each station location.

If the remote station includes an operator's terminal with keyboard and
CRT or printer, the station password may be omitted from the station
command.  The system will then request the station password and either
suppress printing of the password or hide it with a suitable mask.
This feature is particularly useful when a remote station is actually a
high-quality letter printer (e.g., a Diablo 1640), where the printer is
used both as the slave console and as the actual output device.


Remote stations that have no input device do not have to give a station
command.  However, these stations must use a dedicated phone line and
have the station identifier specified in the iod_tables for Type II
remote stations.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
