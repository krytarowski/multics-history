03/20/85 defer_time

Syntax as a command:  defer_time {minor_device} {N}


Function:  sets or displays the current time limit for automatically
deferring requests.


Arguments:
minor_device
   is the name of the minor device for which the time should be set or
   displayed.  It is optional for drivers that have only one minor
   device (e.g., the central site printer).  If specified, this
   argument must be the first argument.
N
   sets a new defer time in minutes, with a precision of tenths (e.g.,
   1.5 is one minute, 30 seconds).  A time of zero indicates that
   infinite time is allowed.  If N is not given, the current defer time
   and driver output rate are displayed.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
