03/20/85 go

Syntax as a command:  go {N}


Function:  specifies that the driver is to search for requests to
process.  If no requests are currently available, the driver asks the
coordinator for a request for each "ready" device.  These requests are
processed as soon as they are provided by the coordinator.  (This
command may not be used at request command level or immediately
following a quit signal.)


Arguments:
N
   is the number of requests processed before the driver returns to
   command level.  If N is not specified, the driver will continue to
   process requests and will not return to command level until
   requested by the operator.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
