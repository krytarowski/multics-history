03/21/85 sample

Syntax as a command:  sample {N}


Function:  used by printer drivers at request command level to print a
sample page of the file for paper alignment or to verify the starting
position in the file.  The current position of a new request is always
page 1.  The same page may be printed as often as needed.


Arguments:
N
   is the page number that the driver prints.  If N is omitted, the
   driver prints the current page in the file.


Notes:  If N is preceded by a "+" or "-", the number is relative to the
current page of the file.  For example, "sample +3" skips forward three
pages and prints the page; "sample -8" skips backward eight pages and
prints the page.  Similarly, "sample 500" skips to page number 500 and
prints it.


If the page number specified is beyond the end of the file, an error
message is printed similar to what is shown below.

      End-of-File record encountered. EOF at page 2000, line 10.
      Unable to skip to starting page.
      Enter command(request):

      and a new command is requested.

The sample command prints a page with separator bars as an aid to
the operator in indicating the sample pages so they can be
discarded.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
