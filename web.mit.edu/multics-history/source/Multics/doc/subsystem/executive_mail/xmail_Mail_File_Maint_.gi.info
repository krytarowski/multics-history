This option displays the names of all mail files.



:Info:  Create:  Create

This option enables you to create a new mail file.  After selecting
this option, you are asked for the name of the mail file you wish to
create.  If you want to see the mail file names already being used,
type two question marks (??)  followed by RETURN.  You can use any name
that is not already used.



:Info:  Archive:  Archive

This option enables you to place all of the messages of a file into
another file called "xmail_archive".  Storing several separate mail
files in xmail_archive maximizes the use of storage space.  After
selecting this option, you are asked which mail file you wish to
archive.  At this point you can type two question marks (??)  followed
by RETURN to get a list of your mail files, and you can then select one
from the displayed list.  This list is automatically displayed without
a prompt, if you have set the personalize mail option "Display Lists As

The messages being archived are deleted from the file though the file
itself is not discarded.  If you wish, you can discard the file with
the "Discard File" option.



:Info:  Print:  Print

This option produces a printed copy of one of your mail files.  After
selecting this option, you are asked which mail file you wish to print.

displayed list.  This list is automatically displayed without a prompt,
if you have set the personalize mail option "Display Lists As Menus" to
yes.



:Info:  Empty:  Empty

This option enables you to discard all of the messages in one of your
mail files.  After selecting this option, you are asked which mail file
you wish to empty.  At this point you can type two question marks (??)
followed by RETURN to get a list of your mail files, and you can then
select one from the displayed list.  This list is automatically
displayed without a prompt, if you have set the personalize mail option
"Display Lists As Menus" to yes.  Note that only the messages are
discarded, not the file itself.



:Info:  Rename:  Rename

This option enables you to rename a file.  After selecting this option,
you are asked which mail file you wish to rename.  At this point you
can type two question marks (??)  followed by RETURN to get a list of
your mail files, and you can then select one from the displayed list.
This list is automatically displayed without a prompt, if you have set
the personalize mail option "Display Lists As Menus" to yes.  You are
then asked for the new name you wish to give the file.



:Info:  List_Messages:  List Messages

    This option displays a one line summary for each message in one of
your mail files.  After selecting this option, you are asked which mail
file you wish to list.  At that point you can type two question marks
(??)  followed by RETURN to get a list of your mail files, and you can
then select one from the displayed list.  This list is automatically
displayed without a prompt, if you have set the personalize mail option
"Display Lists As Menus" to yes.



:Info:  Discard_File:  Discard File

This option enables you to discard a mail file that you previously
created.  After selecting this option, you are asked which mail file
you wish to discard.  At this point you can type two question marks
(??)  followed by RETURN to get a list of your mail files.  You can
then select one from the displayed list.  This list is automatically
displayed without a prompt, if you have set the personalize mail option
"Display Lists As Menus" to yes.

To ensure that you do not discard a mail file by mistake, you are asked
if you really wish to discard it.  If there are any messages in the
file, you are asked if you wish to print the contents of the mail file
which you selected.  If you type "yes", the messages in the file are
printed before the file is deleted.  If the Personalize Mail Option for
"Confirm Print Options" is set to "yes", you are prompted to review
your print options first.  If you type "no" to printing the contents of
the mail file, the messages along with the mail file are deleted
without being printed.



:Info:  Retrieve_Messages:  Retrieve Messages

This option retrieves messages that you have taken out of the file by
archiving or with the "Empty" option.  To work successfully, this
option must be used before you use an option that changes the mail file
currently being worked with.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
