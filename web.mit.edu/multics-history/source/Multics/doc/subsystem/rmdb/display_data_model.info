12/20/86  display_data_model, ddm, dmdm

Syntax:  ddm {-control_args}


Function:  Displays the model definition of a MRDS data base, including
domain, attribute, and relation information.


Control arguments:
-attribute {modifier}, -attr {modifier}
   displays attribute information.  The modifier may be name(s) or
   -unreferenced (-unref).  If name(s) is supplied, information for the
   attribute name(s) is displayed.  If -unreferenced is supplied,
   attribute information about all unreferenced attributes is
   displayed.  If no modifier is supplied, attribute information about
   all attributes is displayed.
-brief, -bf
   specifies that the brief format be displayed.  This argument is
   incompatible with -names.


-cmdb
   specifies that the output be in the same format as an input source
   text for create_mrds_db.  If the -output_file control argument is
   included in the invocation, then the segment can be used to create
   another data base with the same definitions.  Only the -brief,
   -long, and -output_file control arguments can be used with this
   control argument.


-crossref {type}, -xref {type}
   displays an information cross-reference.  The type may be domain
   (dom), attribute (attr), or all.  If the type is domain, each domain
   is listed with a list of attributes in which the domain is
   referenced.  If the type is attribute, each attribute is listed with
   a list of relations in which the attribute is referenced.  If the
   type is all, both domain and attribute cross-references are
   displayed.  (Default is "all".)  See the examples below which show
   the information displayed.


-domain {modifier}, -dom {modifier}
   displays domain information.  The modifier may be name(s) or
   -unreferenced (-unref).  If name(s) is supplied, information for the
   domain name(s) is displayed.  If -unreferenced is supplied, domain
   information about all unreferenced domains is displayed.  If no
   modifier is supplied, domain information about all domains is
   displayed.
-header, -he
   displays data base header information.
-history, -hist
   displays restructuring history information.  If the data base is
   restructured more then once, the history entries are displayed in
   reverse chronological order.


-index names, -ix names
   displays information about indexed relations for the relation names
   supplied.  If no names are supplied, then information about all
   indexed relations is displayed.
-long, -lg
   specifies that the long format be displayed.  This argument is
   incompatible with -names.
-names, -nm
   displays the format of domains, attributes, relations, and indexed
   relations as a list of the names.  This argument is incompatible
   with -brief or -long.
-no_header, -nhe
   prevents display of the header information.  (Default)
-no_output_file, -nof
   writes the output to the terminal.  (Default)


-output_file path, -of path
   writes the output to path, rather than to the terminal.
-relation names, -rel names
   displays relation information for the relation names supplied.  If
   no names are supplied, the relation information about all relations
   is displayed.
-temp_dir path
   specifies that the directory indicated by path be used for temporary
   storage.


Notes:  If no control arguments are supplied, the default relation
information is displayed.


Examples:
If the data base "little" is created from the source:

     domain:  code fixed bin, address char(20);
     relation:  zip(code* address);

 the results would be as follows:

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
