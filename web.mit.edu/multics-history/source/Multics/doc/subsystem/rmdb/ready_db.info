12/20/86  ready_db, rdb

Syntax:  rdb {db_path} {-control_args}


Function:  Readies a data base to be restructured.


Arguments:
db_path
   Relative or absolute path to the data base to be restructured.  The
   db suffix is assumed if it is not supplied.


Control arguments:
-force, -fc
   specifies that the data base be created if it does not already exist
   without querying the user.
-no_force, -nfc
   overrides the -force control argument.  (Default) The last
   occurrence of -force and -no_force on the command line takes effect.
-pathname db_path, -pn db_path
   specifies the path for the data base to be restructured.  The last
   path supplied is the readied one.
-quiesce_wait_time N, -qwt N
   specifies the number of seconds to wait for all open users to close
   the data base.  (Default is 0)


-relation_type type {modes}, -rt type {modes}
   specifies the type of relation to create if the data base does not
   already exist.  The supported types are vfile_ and
   data_management_file (dmf) (see Notes below).  The mode argument is
   only valid for dmf-type relations, and the supported modes are any
   combination of protection, concurrency, or rollback separated by
   commas.  Any mode may be preceded with a not sign (^) to negate it.


Notes:  DBAs are the only persons who can ready a data base for
restructuring.


The data base should not be readied if there are any open users Once
the data base is readied, it can be opened by the process that has
readied it.


The db_path argument cannot refer to a submodel or a data base earlier
than Version 4.


This request can be run only against a consistent data base.  If the
data base is inconsistent, the user is queried to see if he/she wishes
to execute the "undo request" and make the data base consistent.  After
executing the undo request, the data base can be readied.  If the undo
request fails, the user is returned to rmdb request level (i.e., the
data base is not readied).


When this request is used to create a new data base, and the
-relation_type argument is not specified, the data base is created with
the default relation type of vfile_.


Only one data base can be readied at any given time.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
