12/20/86  create_relation, crr

Syntax:  crr relation_name {rel_attribute_list} {-control_args}


Function:  create a new relation in a data base.


Arguments:
relation_name
   is the name of the relation to be created.
rel_attribute_list
   is a list of the attribute names used in the relation.  The
   rel_attribute_list has the syntax of attr_1 attr_2 ...  attr_n
   (where "attr_"s are the attribute names of the attributes to be used
   for the relation).  The attribute names that are to make up the
   primary key of the relation must have an appended "*".  The
   rel_attribute_list cannot be used if the -selection_exp control
   argument is provided.


Control arguments:
-index STR, -ix STR
   specifies the list of attributes in the relation that are indexed.
   STR has the syntax of attr_1 attr_2 ...  attr_n (where "attr_"s are
   the attribute names of the attributes to be indexed).  If the
   -selection_exp control argument is used, the -index control argument
   must precede the -selection_exp control argument.
-selection_exp STR {select_values}, -se STR {select_values}
   STR is a selection expression that defines relation attributes that
   are to be created and populated using the data selected by the
   selection expression.  See "help mrds.selection_expressions" for the
   define_temp_rel selection expression specification.  The selection
   expression must be a separately quoted string with any select_values
   provided as individual arguments.  The -selection_exp control
   argument, if provided, must be the last control argument.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
