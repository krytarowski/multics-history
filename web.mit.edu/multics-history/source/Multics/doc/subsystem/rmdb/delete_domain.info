12/20/86 delete_domain, dld

Syntax:  dld {domain1 {...domainN} {-control_args}


Function:  This request deletes the specified domains from a MRDS data
base.  The domains may be referenced or unreferenced.


Arguments:
domaini
   are the domains to be deleted.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   deletes all domains defined in the MRDS data base.  This control
   argument is inconsistent with -check.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the trace display.  (Default) The last occurrence of
   -brief and -long on the command line takes effect.  This argument is
   inconsistent with -check.


-check, -ck
   prevents the deletion of any domains selected during the execution
   of this command, and instead, traces all implied operations upon the
   data base and displays them on the terminal.  This trace consists of
   a statement for each domain that is referenced, listing the domain
   that is to be deleted, a list of attributes that are based upon the
   domain, and a list of all relations that are to be modified.
   Inconsistent with -brief or -long.
-force, -fc
   prevents the query from being issued for domains which are
   referenced in the MRDS data base.  (Default is to issue a separate
   query for each referenced domain.)
-inhibit_error, -ihe
   prevents error messages from being issued to the terminal.  (Default
   is to issue error messages.)


-long, -lg
   displays the same output as -check; however, the specified domains
   are deleted.  The last occurrence of -brief and -long on the command
   line takes effect.  This control argument is inconsistent with
   -check.
-no_force, -nfc
   overrides the -force control argument.  The last occurrence of
   -force and -no_force on the command line takes effect.  (Default)
-no_inhibit_error, -nihe
   overrides the action of -inhibit_error.  (Default)
-unreferenced, -unref
   deletes only unreferenced domains.  This control argument is
   inconsistent with -check and -all.


Notes:  If the domain is referenced in attributes, which are themselves
referenced in relations, ripple effects take place.  When the domains
are actually deleted, all attributes based upon them are also deleted.
This will cause the relations that use the deleted attributes to be
reformatted.


Specifying either -all or -unreferenced and a list of domain names on
the request line is flagged as an inconsistent error.


A query is issued for each referenced domain that is to be deleted to
ensure against catastrophic data loss.  The query is of the form:

     Domain clock_value is used in attributes "clock_value",
     "start_date", "stop_date", and "current_date" which are referenced
     in relations "permanent_employees" and "temporary_employees".  Do
     you wish to delete it?

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
