Function:  boots Multics.  This command is valid at the "boot" and
"bce_crash" command levels.


Arguments:
command
   can be one of the following ring 1 command abbreviations:

         mult         multics
         salv         salvage_dirs
         stan         standard
         star         startup

keywords
   can be one or more of the following:
   nodt

   nolv
      recreates the logical volume registration directory (>lv);
      renames and ignores the existing one.
   rlvs
      performs a volume salvage of the RPV (root physical volume), a
      directory salvage of all directories used in initialization, and
      a volume salvage of all other member volumes of the RLV (root
      logical volume).
   rpvs
      performs a volume salvage of the RPV and a directory salvage of
      all directories used in initialization.


Control arguments:

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
