09/25/86  fwload, fw

Syntax as a command:  fw mpc_name {...  mpc_names}


Function:  loads firmware into the specified MPCs.  It scans the config
deck to determine the location of the MPC and the type of peripherals
involved to determine the firmware and overlays needed.  This command
is not valid at the BCE "early" command level.


Arguments:
mpc_name
   is the name of an MPC into which firmware is to be loaded.


Notes:  This command can be used on disk MPCs only if they are fully
crossbarred.

Noncrossbarred disk MPCs must be loaded as part of BCE
initialization or by use of the "reinitialize (reinit)" BCE command.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
