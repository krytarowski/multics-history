04/05/85 init_files

Syntax as a command:  init_files {-control_arg}


Function:  wipes out all files in the BCE file system.  It is to be
used only if a problem is encountered with the BCE file system.  This
command is valid at all BCE command levels.


Control arguments:
-force, -fc
   clears the BCE file system without querying you first.  If this
   control argument is not used, the init_files command asks you if the
   BCE file system should really be cleared before it clears it.


Notes:  Refer to the Multics System Maintenance Procedures manual,
Order No.  AM81, for information on reloading the BCE file system after
it has been initialized.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
