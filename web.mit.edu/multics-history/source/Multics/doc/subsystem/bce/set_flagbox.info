04/05/85  set_flagbox, sfb

Syntax as a command:  sfb flagbox_variable value


Syntax as an active function:  [sfb flagbox_variable value]


Function:  changes the values of various flagbox variables.  When used
as an active function, it also returns the previous value of the
variable.  It is valid at all BCE command levels.


Arguments:
flagbox_variable
   is one of the valid flagbox variables listed below:
   N
      where N is from 1 to 36.  The returned value is the Nth flagbox
      flag.  These flags have true or false values.  Some of them are
      named and can be referred to by their names, as listed below.
   auto_reboot
      (also flag 1).  Used by the auto BCE exec_com.  Refer to the
      Multics System Maintenance Procedures manual, Order No.  AM81,
      for more details.
   booting
      (also flag 2).  Used by the auto BCE exec_com.


   rebooted
      (also flag 4).  Used by the auto BCE exec_com.
   unattended
      (also flag 5).  Used by the auto BCE exec_com.
   bce_command
      a command that is invoked by BCE whenever it reaches a command
      level.  The result is a character string, quoted.  This command
      may be set so that BCE can be set to automatically boot Multics
      upon a crash, etc.  Refer to the Multics System Maintenance
      Procedures manual, Order No.  AM81, for more details.
   ssenb
      a flag set by Multics indicating whether or not the storage
      system was enabled at the time of a crash.  A value of true
      indicates that an emergency shutdown needs to be performed (or
      did not succeed).


   call_bce
      indicates that BCE was called through a program calling call_bce.
      This may be the result of the user having entering the bce
      command.
   shut
      indicates that Multics successfully shut down.  If neither shut
      nor call_bce is set, Multics either encountered a breakpoint,
      crashed or was manually brought to BCE.
   manual_crash
      indicates that BCE was invoked manually, either by the user
      manually forcing a return to BCE (XED 24000) or by the user
      hitting the EXECUTE FAULT button.
value
   is either a character string (for the bce_command variable) or the
   string "true" or "false" (for other flagbox variables).

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
