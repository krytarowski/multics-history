04/05/85  qedx, qx

Syntax as a command:  qx {-control_args} {macro_path} {macro_args}


Function:  invokes the qedx text editor to edit a BCE file system file.
All requests of the standard Multics qedx editor are supported except
for the "e" request.  For complete information, see the description of
qedx in the Multics Commands and Active Functions manual, Order No.
AG92.  This command is valid at all BCE command levels.


Arguments:
macro_path
   specifies the pathname of a segment from which the editor is to take
   its initial instructions.  Such a set of instructions is commonly
   referred to as a macro.  The editor automatically concatenates the
   suffix "qedx" to macro_path to obtain the complete pathname of the
   segment containing the qedx instructions.


macro_args
   are optional arguments that are appended, each as a separate line,
   to the buffer named "args" (the first optional argument becomes the
   first line in the buffer and the last optional argument becomes the
   last line).  Arguments are used in conjunction with a macro
   specified by the macro_path argument.

   The editor executes the qedx requests contained in the segment
   selected and then waits for you to type further requests.  If
   macro_path is omitted, the editor waits for you to type a qedx
   request.


Control arguments:
-no_rw_path
   prevents the user from making read (r) or write (w) requests with a
   pathname.  All read and write requests for buffer 0 affect the
   pathname specified by the -pathname control argument.  The
   -no_rw_path control argument is intended to be used within exec_coms
   which are providing a limited environment; the user is prevented
   from examining or altering segments other than the one specified
   with -pathname.


-pathname path, -pn path
   causes qedx to read the segment given by path into buffer 0,
   simulating "r path," before executing a macro (see macro_path).
   This control argument must precede macro_path.  If no macro is
   specified, the user is placed immediately in the editor request
   loop.


Notes:  Complete tutorial information on qedx is available in the qedx
Text Editor User's Guide, Order No.  CG40.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
