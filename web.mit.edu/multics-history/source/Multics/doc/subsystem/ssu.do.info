01/24/82  Standard subsystem request:  do

Syntax:  do request_string {args}
  or:    do -control_args


Syntax as an active request:  [do "request_string" args]


Function:  expands a request line by substituting the supplied
arguments into the line before execution.  As an active request,
returns the expanded request_string rather than executing it.


Arguments: 
request_string
   is a request line in quotes.
args
   are character string arguments that replace parameters in
   request_string.


Control arguments:
   These control argument set the mode of operation of the do request:
-long, -lg
   the expanded request line is printed before execution.
-brief, -bf
   the expanded request line is not printed before execution. (Default)
-nogo
   the expanded request line is not passed on for execution.
-go
   the expanded request line is passed on for execution.  (Default)
-absentee
   an any_other handler is established which catches all conditions and
   aborts execution of the request line without aborting the process.
-interactive
   the any_other handler is not established.  (Default)


List of parameters:
   Any sequence beginning with & in the request line is expanded by the
   do request using the arguments given on the request line.

&I  is replaced by argI.  I must be a digit from 1 to 9.
&(I)
   is also replaced by argI.  I can be any value, however.
&qI
   is replaced by argI with any quotes in argI doubled.  I must be a
   digit from 1 to 9.
&q(I)
   is also replaced by argI with any quotes doubled.  I can be any
   value.
&rI
   is replaced by argI surrounded by a level quotes with any contained
   quotes doubled.  I must be a digit from 1 to 9.
&r(I)
   is also replaced by a requoted argI.  I can be any value.


&fI
   is replaced by all the arguments starting with argI.  I must be a
   digit from 1 to 9.
&f(I)
   is also replaced by all the arguments starting with argI.  I can be
   any value.
&qfI
   is replaced by all the arguments starting with argI with any quotes
   doubled.  I must be a digit from 1 to 9.
&qf(I)
   is also replaced by all the arguments starting with argI with quotes
   doubled.  I can be any value.


&rI
   is replaced by all the arguments starting with argI.  Each argument
   is placed in a level of quotes with contained quotes doubled.  I
   must be a digit from 1 to 9.
&rf(I)
   is also replaced by all the arguments starting with argI, requoted.
   I can be any value.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
