10/17/84  Kermit server commands

The following generic commands can be issued from a microcomputer 
kermit to a Multics-Kermit server.  Actual syntax varies from 
system to system. See the "Kermit User Guide" for your
implementation of kermit.


List of generic commands:

SEND filespec   
   sends  a  file  or file group from the microcomputer to Multics.  

GET filespec
   ask Multics to send a file or file group to the microcomputer.  

BYE
   shuts down the Multics-Kermit server and logs out from Multics.

FINISH
   shuts down the Multics server, returning to kermit command level
   on the microcomputer.  A subsequent connect command will put you
   back to the Multics-Kermit command level.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
