08/23/83   Formatting Options (General Information):

Formatting options control the layout of a report.  A formatting option
consists of a name to identify it and a value which it is set to.
Examples of formatting options are "-page_width 80" and "-title_line
on".  Formatting options which deal with columns require an option
identifier to uniquely identify the column.  For example, to set the
width of a column, an identifier is needed to determine which column
the width should be set for.  Identifiers can be given as the number of
the column in the LILA selection-expression, the name of the column as
defined in the open model or submodel, or a star name which is matched
against the column names.  Examples of formatting options with
identifiers are "-width salary 10", "-folding 3 fill", and "-width **
20".


The values of format options are listed and set through the
"list_format_options" and "set_format_options" requests.  These
requests take control arguments which are the names of the format
options.  For example, to find out what the current page width is, the
request "list_format_options -page_width" would be given.  To change
the page width, the request "set_format_options -page_width 65" would
be used.


Classifications:

The formatting options can be grouped into three classifications:
general report options; general column options; and specific column
options.

General report options control overall characteristics of a report,
such as the page width.  They are given a default value when linus is
first invoked, and can be changed by the user at any time.  They retain
their value across a complete linus session.


General column options control overall characteristics of the columns,
such as watching the value of certain columns to determine if a page
break should be generated.  They are given a default value for every
new LILA selection-expression, and can be changed by the user at any
time.  They retain their value until the next new LILA
selection-expression.

Specific column options control the characteristics of one specific
column, such as a column's width.  They are given a default value for
every new LILA selection-expression, and can be changed by the user at
any time.  They retain their value until the next new LILA
selection-expression.  These are the only formatting options which
require an identifier to determine which column the particular option
applies to.


Active options:

All specific column options are considered active at all times.
General column options and general report options are considered active
only when their value is different from the default value they are
originally given.  For example, if -page_width is always set to its
default value it is not considered active.  The moment that it is
changed to a value different from its default it is considered active.
This, for example, reduces the number of options listed when a user
types the "list_format_options" request with no control arguments.  The
-page_width option would never be listed if it was set to its default
value, unless it was specifically asked for.


General report options:

-delimiter          -format_document_controls     -hyphenation
-page_footer_value  -page_header_value            -page_length
-page_width         -title_line                   -truncation


General column options:

-column_order         -count                      -exclude
-group                -group_footer_trigger       -group_footer_value
-group_header_trigger -group_header_value         -outline
-page_break           -row_footer_value           -row_header_value
-subcount             -subtotal                   -total


Specific column options:

-alignment          -editing                      -folding
-separator          -title                        -width

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
