08/05/81  modify, m

Syntax:  m {column_values} {-control_arg}


Function:  modifies the selected data in the data base.


Arguments:
column_values
   if present, specify the new values to replace the selected data in
   the data base (DEFAULT -- LINUS will request column_values 
   individually by name).


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   specifies that verification of column_values is not to be done
   (DEFAULT -- the user is requested to verify the correctness of the
   column_values before the modification takes place).


Notes:
Only non-key columns, and only columns from one table may be modified.

Column_values may be specified as constants or LINUS variables, or as
arithmetic expressions combining constants, LINUS variables, and
possibly the name of the column names form the LILA select clause.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
