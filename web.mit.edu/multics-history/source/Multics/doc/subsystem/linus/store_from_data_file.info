Syntax:  store_from_data_file table_name -control_args


Function:  reads data from a file and loads it into the specified
table.


Arguments:

table_name
   is the name of the table defined in the open model or submodel.


Control arguments:

-column_delimiter X, -cdm X
   where X is a single ascii character which will be used to delimit
   the column values.  If this control argument isn't specified the
   default column delimiter is the tilde.

-input_file pathname, -if pathname
   specifies the name of the file which contains the input data.

-no_progress, -npg
   specifies that progress messages should not be printed. (DEFAULT)

-no_warning, -no_warn
   specifies that warning messages should not be printed when storing
   the tuple results in a conversion error or duplicate tuple error.


-progress {N}, -pg {N}
   specifies that a progress message should be printed after N tuples
   have been processed, where N is any positive integer. If N is not
   specified the default is to print a progress message after 1000
   tuples.

-row_delimiter X, -rdm X
   where X is a single ascii character which will be used to delimit
   the row values.  If this control argument isn't specified the
   default row delimiter is the newline character.

-warning, -warn
   specifies that warning messages are printed when storing the tuple
   results in a conversion error or duplicate tuple error. (DEFAULT)

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
