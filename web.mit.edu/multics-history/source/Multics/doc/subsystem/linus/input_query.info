09/06/83   input_query, iq

Syntax:  input_query {-control_args}


Function:  Takes the supplied query and makes it available for LINUS
data manipulation requests.


Control Arguments:

-brief, -bf
   specifies that the prompt "Query:" should be suppressed when the
   query is entered from the terminal.

-force, -fc
   specifies that the existing query should be replaced.  If a query
   exists and this control argument isn't used the user is asked if the
   existing query should be replaced.  A negative response terminates
   the invocation of input_query.


-input_file path, -if path
   specifies that the query should be taken from the file named by
   "path".  If path does not have a suffix of ".lquery", one is
   assumed.

-long, -lg
   specifies that the prompt "Query:" should be written when the query
   is input from the terminal (DEFAULT).


-no_force, -nfc
   specifies that if a query exists the user should be asked if it
   should be replaced (DEFAULT).  A negative response terminates the
   invocation of input_query.

-terminal_input, -ti
   specifies that the query should be read from the terminal (DEFAULT).
   A line consisting of only the single character "."  terminates the
   input.  Typing "\q" anywhere on a line also terminates the input.
   Typing "\f" anywhere on a line terminates the input and enters the
   user directly into the qedx editor with the query.


Examples:

input_query -input_file query_file -force
input_query Query:  select * from sales .

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
