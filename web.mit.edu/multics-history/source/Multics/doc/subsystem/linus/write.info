Syntax:  write pathname {-control_args}


Function:  retrieves the selected data and writes it to the designated
Multics file.


Arguments:

pathname
   is the name of the file where the data will be written to.


Control arguments:

-column_delimiter X, -cdm X
   where X is a single ascii character which will be used to delimit
   the column values.  If this control argument isn't specified the
   default column delimiter is a blank.

-extend
   specifies that if the file already exists it should be extended
   rather than truncated.

-no_progress, -npg
   specifies that progress messages should not be printed. (DEFAULT)


-progress {N}, -pg {N}
   specifies that a progress message should be printed after N tuples
   have been processed, where N is any positive integer. If N is not
   specified the default is to print a progress message after 1000
   tuples.

-row_delimiter X, -rdm X
   where X is a single ascii character which will be used to delimit
   the row values.  If this control argument isn't specified the
   default row delimiter is the newline character.


-truncate
   specifies that if the file already exists it should be truncated.
   This is the default.


Examples:

write employee_data
write employee_data -extend
write employee_data -column_delimiter :

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
