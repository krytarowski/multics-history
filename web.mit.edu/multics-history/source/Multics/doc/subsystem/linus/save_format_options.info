12/01/86   save_format_options, svfo

Syntax:  svfo path {-format_option_args} {-control_args}


Function:  saves the current values of format options as a linus
subsystem exec_com.  The saved format can be restored later with the
restore_format_options request.  The file is saved with a suffix of
".fo.lec".  Individual format options; active format options; or all
the format options can be saved.  The selection expression can also be
saved.


Arguments:
path
   the pathname of the segment which will contain the saved format.
   The suffix ".fo.lec" is appended if not given.


 Format Option Arguments

 Refer to the description of the set_format_options request for a
 complete list of the names of the format option arguments.  Each format
 option named will have its value saved in the exec_com specified by
 path.  These arguments are incompatible with the control arguments
 -all and -active listed below.


Control arguments:
-active, -act
   specifies that only the active formatting options will be saved.
   (DEFAULT) Type "help formatting_options.gi" for more information on
   "active" formatting options.  This control argument is incompatible
   with the format option arguments and "-all".
-all, -a
   specifies that all formatting options should be saved.  This control
   argument is incompatible with the format option arguments and
   "-active".
-query
   specifies that the current query should also be
   saved.  A restore_format_options on the saved format will also
   restore and process the saved selection expression.


Examples:
save_format_options report_layout
save_format_options report_layout -all
save_format_options report_layout -selection_expression
save_format_options report_layout -page_header_value -page_footer_value
save_format_options report_layout -page_header_value -width salary
save_format_options report_layout -width ** -page_footer_value

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
