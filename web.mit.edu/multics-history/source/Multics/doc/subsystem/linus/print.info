08/05/81  print, pr

Syntax:  pr {-control_args}


Function:  retrieves selected data and prints it on the terminal.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   specifies that every row of information is to be displayed without
   querying the user (DEFAULT -- 10 lines).
-col_widths W1 ... Wn, -cw W1 ... Wn
   specifies the width of each column to be printed.  Wi may be an
   integer or may be P.Q where P and Q are precision and scale (DEFAULT
   -- determined from database descriptions).  Asterisks are printed if
   the retrieved data cannot be printed in the column widths specified.
-col_widths_truncate W1 ... Wn, -cwt W1 ... Wn
   identical to the -cw control argument except that truncation occurs
   in cases where the retrieved data contains more characters than the
   column widths specified.


-max N
   specifies that no more than N lines are to be printed without the
   user's permission (DEFAULT -- 10 lines).
-no_header, -nhe
   specifies that column headers are not to be printed (DEFAULT --
   print column headers).
-no_end, -ne
   specifies that the string "(END)" is not to be printed after the
   last piece of retrieved data is printed (DEFAULT -- print the
   "(END)" string).


Notes:
Columns are printed side-by-side and there is no pagination.  If
-col_widths is specified, a width must be specified for every column.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
