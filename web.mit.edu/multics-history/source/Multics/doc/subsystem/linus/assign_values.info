Syntax: av variable_list


Syntax as an active request: [av variable_list]


Function: retrieves selected data and assigns it to designated
LINUS variables.  As an active request it returns "true" if data
was sucessfully retrieved and "false" if the select statement
failed.


Arguments:
variable_list
   a list of one or more LINUS variable names (each name must
   begin with "!").


Notes:
Retrieved data is assigned to variables in the order that it is
retrieved.  Retrieval ceases when either the variable_list or
selected data is exhausted.  Variables which have no values to be
assigned to them will not be affected (eg.  values will not be
changed or variable will not be allocated).

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
