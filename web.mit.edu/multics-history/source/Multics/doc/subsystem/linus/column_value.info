12/01/86   column_value, clv

Syntax as an active request:  [clv column_id {-control_arguments}]


Function:  returns the value of the specified column for the current
row, the previous row, or the next row.  This request can only be used
as an active request.  It is used within a formatted report produced by
the display request to obtain a column's value.  It is an error to use
this request anywhere except in a header/footer or editing string
within a report produced by the display request.


Arguments:
column_id
   specifies which column the value should be returned for.  column_id
   can be given as the name of the column as defined in the open
   model/submodel or the number of the column in the query.


Control arguments:
-current_row, -crw
   specifies that the value of the named column for the current row
   should be returned.  This is the default.
-default STR
   where STR is the character string that will be returned when there
   is no previous row, or, when there is no next row.  If this control
   argument is not used the default value for STR is "".
-next_row, -nrw
   specifies that the value of the named column for the next row should
   be returned.  If there is no next row, the string "" is returned
   unless changed by the -default control argument.


-previous_row, -prw
   specifies that the value of the named column for the previous row
   should be returned.  If there is no previous row, the string "" is
   returned unless changed by the -default control argument.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
