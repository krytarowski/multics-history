Syntax:  [display_builtins STR]


Function:  returns the current value of the builtin named by STR.  This
request can only be used as an active request.  It is used within a
formatted report produced by the display request to obtain the current
value of the specified builtin.  It is an error to use this request
anywhere except in a header/footer or editing string within a report
produced by the display request.

STR can be any one of the following builtins:


current_pass_number
   the number of the current pass.  This number begins at 1 and is
   incremented by 1 for each additional formatting pass over the
   report.

current_row_number
   the number of the current row of the report.

first_row
   "true" if the current row is the first row of the report.  "false"
   if it is not the first row of the report.


last_page_number
   the number of the last page of the report, or "0" if it is the first
   pass over the report.  After each formatting pass over the report
   this number is updated with the number of the last page.

last_pass
   "true" if this is the last formatting pass of the report.  "false"
   if this is not the last pass of the report.

last_row
   "true" if the current row is the last row of the report.  "false" if
   the current row is not the last row of the report.


last_row_number
   the number of the last row of the table, or "0" if it is the first
   pass over the report.  After the first formatting pass over the
   report this number is set to the number of the last row.

page_number
   the number of the current page of the report.

previously_processed_row
   "true" if the current row had been processed on the preceding page,
   but the row value would not fit and had to be deferred to the
   current page.  "false" if this is the first time the current row has
   been processed.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
