12/01/86  create_list, cls

Syntax:  cls path {-control_args}


Function:  specifies that selected data is to be retrieved and written
to a specified Lister file.  This file can be manipulated via Lister
commands to create a formatted report.  A translated or translatable
query must be available.


Arguments:
path
   pathname of a Multics file into which the selected data is to be
   written.  The data is written in a form suitable for processing by
   Lister.  The suffix lister is appended to the pathname (if not
   present in the invocation) and the file is created if it does not
   exist.  If the file currently exists, it is truncated unless the
   -extend control argument is specified.


Control arguments:
-extend
   specifies that if the Lister file already exists, it is to be added
   to rather than truncated.  The field names (either default or
   explicitly specified) must be identical to those defined in the
   existing file.
-field_names STR, -fn STR
   explicitly specifies the field names in the Lister file being
   created or extended.  STR is a list of field names that must
   correspond in order and quantity to the items specified in the
   select clause of the associated query.  This control argument must
   be specified if the query select clause contains an expression.  If
   not specified, the names of the selected data base columns become
   the lister file field names.


Notes:  The values being written to the lister file have all leading
and trailing blanks stripped off.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
