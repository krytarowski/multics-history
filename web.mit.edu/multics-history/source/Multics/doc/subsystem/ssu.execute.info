01/24/82  Standard subsystem request:  execute, e

Syntax:  e LINE


Syntax as an active request:  [e LINE]


Function:  executes the supplied line as a Multics command line.  As an
active request, evaluates a Multics active string and returns the
result to the subsystem request processor.


Arguments:
LINE
   is the Multics command line to be executed or the Multics active
   string to be evaluated.  It need not be enclosed in quotes.


Notes:
The recommended method to execute a Multics command line from within
a subsystem is the ".." escape sequence.  The execute request is
intended as a means of passing information from the subsystem to the
Multics command processor.

All (), [], and "'s in the given line are processed by the subsystem
request processor and not the Multics command processor.  This fact
permits the passing of the values of subsystem active requests to
Multics commands when using the execute request or, when using the
execute active request, to Multics active functions for further
manipulation before returning the values to the subsystem request
processor for use within a request line.


Examples:
The read_mail request line:
   e mbla [mailbox]
can be used to list the ACL of the mailbox being read by the current
invocation of read_mail.

The read_mail request line:
   write all [e strip_entry [mailbox]]
may be used to to write the ASCII representation of all messages in the
mailbox into a segment in the working directory whose entry name is the
same as that of the mailbox with the "mbx" suffix changed to "mail".

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
