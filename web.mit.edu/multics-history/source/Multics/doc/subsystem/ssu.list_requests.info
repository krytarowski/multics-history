01/24/82  Standard subsystem request:  list_requests, lr

Syntax:  lr {STRs} {-control_args}


Function:  prints a brief description of selected subsystem requests.


Arguments:
STRs
   specifies the requests to be listed.  Any request with a name
   containing one of these strings is listed unless -exact is used in
   which case the request name must exactly match one of these strings.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   includes undocumented and unimplemented requests in the list of
   requests eligible for matching the STR arguments.
-exact
   lists only those requests one of whose names exactly match one of
   the STR arguments.


Notes:
If no STRs are given, all requests are listed.

When matching STRs with request names, a request name is considered
to match a STR only if that STR is at the beginning or end of a word
within the request name.  Words in request names are bounded by the
beginning and end of the request name and by the characters period (.),
hyphen (-), underscore (_), and dollar sign ($).


Examples:
The request line:
   list_requests list
will match requests named list, list_users, and forum_list but will not
match a request named prelisting.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
