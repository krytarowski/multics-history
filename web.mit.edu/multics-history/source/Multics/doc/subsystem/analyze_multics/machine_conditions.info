01/19/84      machine_conditions, mc

Syntax:  mc {MC_specifier} {-control_args}

Function: Displays all or parts of Machine Conditions based on the
given pointer.


Argument (MC Specifiers):
-dump                                                         
   specifies the dump for the BOS CPU regs at time of dump.
-pds {STR1}                                                   
   where STR1 can be:                                      
         all                                                
         fim, fim_data
         pgf, page_fault, page_fault_data
         sig, signal, signaller, signal_data                   
   and  defaults to 'all' if STR1 is not given.            
-prds {STR2}                                                  
   where STR2 can be:                                      
         all                                                 
         fim, fim_data
         int, interrupt, interrupt_data
         sys, system_trouble, sys_trouble_data
   and defaults to 'all' if not given.                     
VIRTUAL-ADDR                                                  
   is the virtual address construct used to define the address space
   containing Machine Conditions (see virtual_address.info).
   The virtual address can point to the machine conditons directly or
   it can point to the frame within which the machine conditions reside. 
   In the latter case, the offset is calulated for the user.

Control arguments:
-eis
   display the EIS Pointers & Lengths (interpreted).
-faults, -flt
   display the fault register.
-long, -lg
   display all elements of the MC.
-mc_err
   display the mc_err data word.
-misc
   display the miscellaneous data (ie:  mc_err, fault reg, time)
-octal, -oc
   display the eis info, scu data, or pointer registers in octal. 
   -octal is used in conjunction with -scu, -eis or -regs.
-pointers {PR_LIST}, -prs {PR_LIST}
   displays pointer registers selected by PR_LIST (from 0 to 7,
   separated by spaces).  If PR_LIST is not specified, all the pointers
   are displayed.
-ppr
   only display the PSR and IC from the MC.


-registers {REG_LIST}, -regs {REG_LIST}

   displays only the basic OU registers.  Where REGS_LIST can be any of
   the following:

     x0 x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 x7 a q all.

   If REG_LIST is not specified, all of the basic OU registers are 
   displayed.

-scu
   display only the scu data of the MC.
-time, -tm
   display the MC time.
-tpr
   only display the TSR and the CA from the MC.


Notes: If no MC Specifiers are specified, the temporary pointer prmc is
used.  The default control arguments are:
      -fault, -mc_err, -pointers -scu, -time and -tpr.
The machine_conditions request will set all azm-defined temporary
pointers as seen in the machine_condition frame.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
