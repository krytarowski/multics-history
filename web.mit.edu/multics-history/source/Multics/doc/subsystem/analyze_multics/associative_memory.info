07/20/83 associative_memory, am

Syntax:  am {-control_args}

Function:  Display SDW and/or PTW Associative Memories.


Control Arguments (Location):
-dump 
   displays the "dump" Associative Memories from the BOS CPU at the
   time the dump was taken.  (Default).
-prds                                                         
   displays Associative memories that have been stored in the current
   processes prds.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   Specifies that ALL entries in the Associative Memories are to be
   displayed.  Default is to display only those entries that are valid
   (i.e., the full bit is on).
-ptw 
   Specifies that only the PTW Associative memories are to be displayed.
-pageno PAGENO
   where PAGENO is an octal page number.  Displays only those entries
   in the PTW Associative Memories that have a page number that matches
   the value of PAGENO.
-sdw
   Specifies that only the SDW Associative Memories are to be
   displayed.
-segno SEGNO
   where SEGNO is an octal segment number.  Displays only those entries
   in the SDW and PTW Associative Memories that have a segment number
   that matches the value of SEGNO.  See assoc_mem.incl.pl1.


Notes: If no control arguments are given, BOTH the SDW and PTW
Associative Memories are displayed for the "dump" Associative Memories.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
