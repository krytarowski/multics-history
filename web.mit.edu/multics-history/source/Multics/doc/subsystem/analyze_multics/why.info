08/15/83  why

Syntax:  why


Function: The why request will try to find the stack that has a call to
syserr_real$syserr_real or call_bce$call_bce and set the temporary
pointers, pr6 and prfr, to the stack frame.  This command will search
the stacks for a frame that has a return_to_ring_0_ frame and set the
temporary pointers from this set of machine conditions that called this
entry.
    

Notes: If the crash was due to fim_util$check_fault finding a problem, the
machine condition CU data is displayed and all temporary pointers are
set from these machine conditions.  If this was an Execute Fault then
some lock info is printed an the process selected is lock ordered.
First sst_seg$ptl followed by sst_seg$aslt then scs$connect_lock next
tty_buf$slock and last tty_buf$timer_lock.
     						
If this fdump was due to a manual return to BOS then some pertinent lock
info will also be printed.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
