01/23/85  events, ev


Syntax: events {-control_args}


Function: Displays 'interesting events', in reverse chronological
order, from an FDUMP.  Those events considered to be interesting are
described in 'notes'.


Control arguments:
-exclude STRING, -ex STRING
   does not print lines containing STRING.  Exclusion is done after
   matching.  Thus, "-match A -exclude B" prints all lines with an A
   except those with a B.
-exclude /REGEXP/, -ex /REGEXP/
   does not print lines containing a string matching the regular
   expression REGEXP.  (See the qedx command for the definition of
   regular expressions.)
-last {N}, -lt {N}
   specifies the number of events to print. If no N, the default is
   10 events.
-long, -lg
   specifies that disk queue events are to be displayed.


-match STRING, -mh STRING
   prints only lines containing the character string STRING.
-match /REGEXP/, -mh /REGEXP/
   prints only lines containing a string matching the regular
   expression REGEXP.
-time {NSECS}, -tm {NSECS}
   specifies the time in seconds before the dump was taken when events
   were 'interesting'.  Default is 10 seconds.


Notes: The following events are considered as interesting: Machine
Conditions (from BCE, prds, pds and the mc_trace_buf), Traffic Control
state change time, Syserr messages (from both syserr_data and
syserr_log), Fim frames in any stack, connects by device and disk
queues (long report ONLY).

If neither -time nor -last are specified, the default action is
equivalent to "ev -time 10".

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
