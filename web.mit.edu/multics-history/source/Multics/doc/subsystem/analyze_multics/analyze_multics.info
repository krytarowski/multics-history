07/27/83   analyze_multics, azm

Syntax:  analyze_multics {-control_args}

Function: Invoke a subsystem that will permit the scanning of a Multics
address space for analysis.


Control arguments:
-abbrev, -ab
   enables abbreviation expansion of request lines.
-no_abbrev, -nab
   does not enable abbreviation expansion of request lines. (Default)
-no_prompt
   suppresses the prompt for request lines in the request loop.
-no_start_up, -nsu
   specifies that no startup exec_com is to be executed.  (Default)
-profile PATH, -pf PATH
   specifies the pathname of the profile to use for abbreviation
   expansion.  The suffix "profile" is added if necessary.  This
   control argument implies -abbrev.
-prompt STR
   sets the request loop prompt to STR.  The default is the ioa_ STR:
                   ^/azm^[ (^d)^]:^2x
-request STR, -rq STR
   executes STR as a analyze_multics request line before entering the
   request loop.
-start_up, -su
   specifies that the exec_com 'start_up.azmec' is to be executed upon
   invocation of analyze_multics.  This start_up exec_com is first
   searched for in the user's home directory, then in the user's
   project directory >udd>Project_id, and last in >site.  The first
   exec_com found is used.
-quit
   Exit analyze_mulitcs after execution of other arguments.  Can be
   used in conjunction with -request.


Notes: analyze_multics uses the standard search list mechanism to
locate FDUMPs.  If analyze_multics does not find a "dumps" search list,
it will create one, placing >dumps in the search list as the default.
If additional search paths are desired the "add_search_path" command
should be used to define them.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
