08/10/83      stack, sk                      

Syntax:  sk VIRTUAL-ADDR {-control_arguments}     

Function:  Traces a given stack.


Argument:
VIRTUAL-ADDR
   is any segment and offset value that is acceptable to the dump
   command.  See virtual_address.info


Control arguments:
-arguments, -ag
   prints the arguments for the stack frames traced.
-for N
   will trace for N stack frames.  If no valid stack
   frames exist (stack_begin_ptr = stack_end_ptr), a -fc must be used.
-force, -fc
   will force a forward stack trace.  To be used when there are no
   valid frames for this stack (stack_begin_ptr = stack_end_ptr).
-forward, -fwd
   will trace in a forward manner.
-long, -lg
   will cause the arguments and an octal dump of the
   stack frames traced.


Notes: The default is to trace the stack in reverse order unless -fc or
-fwd are specified.  If the VIRTUAL-ADDR has a zero offset then the
trace starts at the offset of the first stack
(stack_header.stack_begin_ptr).  If the VIRTUAL-ADDR has a non-zero
offset then the trace is started from that offset in the given stack.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
