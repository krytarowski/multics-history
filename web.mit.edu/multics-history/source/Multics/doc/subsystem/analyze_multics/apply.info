Syntax:  apply VIRTUAL-ADDR {RANGE} command_line

Function: Extracts all or part of a segment, specified by VIRTUAL-ADDR
from the selected FDUMP and places a copy in a temporary segment.  The
new path name is passed as the last argument in the command_line.


Argument:
VIRTUAL-ADDR
   May be a segment number, name or symbolic address (e.g.  64, prds,
   prds$am_data).  Do a 'help virtual_address' for more detailed
   information on acceptable virtual-address constructs.
RANGE
   Specifies the number of words in octal to be copied.  The default is
   the entire segment.
command_line
   any command.


Notes: The offset in the virtual address specifies where the copying of
the segment begins.  When only part of a segment is extracted, it goes
at the beginning of the temporary segment.  For example:

         apply pds$am_data 400 dump_segment

will put 256 (decimal) words at the beginning of the segment.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
