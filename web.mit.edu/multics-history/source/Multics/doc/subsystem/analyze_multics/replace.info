07/26/83  replace, rp

Syntax:  replace segno/segname PATH

Function: Replaces the segment designated by segno/segname in the
current translation table, with another segment designated by PATH.


Argument:
PATH
   is the path name of the segment.  The equal convention can be 
   used: replace bound_system_faults [e wd]>=.new

segno/segname
   the segment number or segment name within the translation table to
    be replaced.


Notes: Both per-process and per-system segments can be replaced.  For
example, if the pds is replaced in a process, it affects only the
current process, whereas if tc_data is replaced in a process, it
affects the whole FDUMP.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
