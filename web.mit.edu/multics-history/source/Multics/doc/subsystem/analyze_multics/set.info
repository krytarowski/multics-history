Syntax:  set PTR_N VIRTUAL-ADDR


Function: set a internal temporary pointer much like a cpu pointer
register (i.e.  "pr6" or "sp").  These pointers can then be used as a
VIRTUAL-ADDR by other analyze_multics commands.


Argument:
VIRTUAL-ADDR
   may be a segment number, name or symbolic address (e.g.  64, prds,
   prds$am_data).  Do a 'help virtual_address' for more detailed
   information on acceptable virtual-address constructs.
PTR_N
   can be either the name or number of a 'temporary pointer'.  There
   are 8 temporary pointers and 2 special case pointers.
        number	 name 	number	 name
           pr0         ap	   pr4	   lp	
	 pr1	   ab	   pr5	   lb
	 pr2	   bp	   pr6	   sp
	 pr3	   bb	   pr7	   sb
          prmc      intended to be a pointer to the current MCs.
	prfr	intended to be a pointer to the current stack frame.


Examples:
      set pr6 240|100   this would set a temporary ptr named pr6 (sp).
      set sb 240	        this would set the temporary ptr (sb) to the
		        base of seg 240 (240|0).


Notes:
     The value of a temporary pointer can be displayed via the value
     request: value  {ptrn | -all}

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
