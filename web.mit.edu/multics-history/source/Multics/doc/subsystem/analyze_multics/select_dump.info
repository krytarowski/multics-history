10/24/84  select_dump, sld                                              

Syntax:  sld {NAME} {-control_args}                           

Function: Selects and translates an FDUMP of a system crash.  Found
via the dump search list which defaults to >dumps.


Argument:
NAME                                                         
   is the ERF number or the path name of the zero (0) component of
   the FDUMP.  It can also be the form path>35 where 35 is the erf
   number.  Several control_args are also acceptable if NAME is not
   specified.


Control arguments:                                           
-first, -ft                                                  
   selects the first dump (by erf number) in the dump directory found
   via the dump search list.
-last, -lt                                                   
   selects the last (most current) dump in the dump directory
   according to erf number.
-next, -nx                                                   
   selects the next dump in the dump directory.  This is relative to
   the dump currently being looked at.
-previous, -prev                                              
   selects the previous dump in the dump directory.  This is relative
   to the dump currently being looked at.


NOTE:
     The sld command will attempt to select the process as
     indicated by scs$trouble_processid.  If this cannot be done
     the the default will be the first running process found in
     the dump.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
