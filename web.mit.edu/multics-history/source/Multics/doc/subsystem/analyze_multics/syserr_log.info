01/21/85   syserr_log, slog

Syntax:  syserr_log {-control_args}


Function: Displays all or parts of the syserr_log and syserr_data
segments from the dump.  It does not examine the perm_syserr_log.  The
default is to print the entire log and all actions.


Control arguments:
-action A
   displays messages starting at severity -100 and up to the action
   code specified by A, where A is a decimal integer between -100 and
   100.  A range can also be specified, consisting of a pair decimal
   integers separated by a colon ("20:29").
-exclude STR -ex STR
   where STR is a string that is matched against the log, as for
   -match.  Any message that contains STR is not printed.


-last N, -lt N
   where N is a decimal integer.  This argument specifies that the scan
   is to start N messages back from the end of the log.
-match STR
   where STR is a string to be matched against messages in the log.
   Any message that contains STR is a candidate to be printed.
-expand, -exp
   specifies that messages that have binary data will have that binary
   data interpreted.  The format is generally dependent on the text of
   the message.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
