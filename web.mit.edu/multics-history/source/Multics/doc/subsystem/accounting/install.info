Syntax as a command:  install path


Function:  installs a system table.  Many of the other commands
described in this manual that modify system tables also automatically
install them.  Therefore, this command should only be used after a
command whose documentation indicates that a system table is modified
but not installed or when an operation that usually installs a system
table is interrupted by a system failure before it can do so.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the system table to be installed or is one of the
   following keywords, sat or smf.cur.sat.  These keywords invoke the
   daily_summary command before the SAT is installed.

   If any other pathname is given, the specified system table is
   installed as described in the privileged Multics install command
   found in Section 2 of Multics Administration, Maintenance, and
   Operations Commands manual, Order No. GB64.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
