Syntax as a command:  upmf Project_id Person_id


Function:  adds a user to a project.  It is used only on projects that
are not delegated.  The command extracts the project's PMF from the
pmf.archive segment (in the >udd>SysAdmin>admin directory), edits the
PMF to add the new entry, converts the PMF to a PDT, signals the
initializer to install the PDT, and replaces the edited PMF in
pmf.archive.  The user is added with no individual attributes, just
those of the project.  To give individual attributes to the user, use
the pmf command.


Arguments:
Project_id
   is the Project_id of the project on which a user is to be added.
Person_id
   is the Person_id of the user to be added to the project.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
