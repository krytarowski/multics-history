   edit_proj Project
or
edit_proj project keyword
or
edit_proj project keyword old_value
or
edit_proj project keyword new_value
or
edit_proj project keyword old_value new_value


Function:
changes project registration information.

The command can be invoked in several ways as described below.

1. The command can be invoked in the format "edit_proj project," in
   which case you are queried for changes to each keyword.

2. The command can be invoked in the format "edit_proj project
   keyword," in which case you are queried for a change only to the
   specified keyword.


3. The command can be invoked in the format "edit_proj project keyword
   old_value."  In this case, "keyword" must be either "administrator"
   or "group" and "old_value" must be one of the multiple values
   associated with "administrator" or "group."  This invocation permits
   you to be queried for a change to the specified value associated
   with the "administrator" or "group" keyword.

4. the command can be invoked in the format "edit_proj project keyword
   new_value," in which case the keyword value is changed to new_value.

5. The command can be invoked in the format "edit_proj project keyword
   old_value new_value," in which case old_value is changed to
   new_value.  In this case, keyword must be either "administrator" or
   "group."


Arguments:
project
   is the project_id of the project whose registration data items are

   administrator may respond with any one of the following:
   carriage return
      to leave the item unchanged.
   a new value
      to replace the printed value.

      to exit immediately from the edit_proj command without making any
      changes.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
