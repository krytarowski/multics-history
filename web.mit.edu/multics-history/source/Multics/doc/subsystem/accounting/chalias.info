03/04/85 chalias

Syntax as a command:  chalias Person_id {alias}


Function:  gives a user a login alias or changes his existing alias.
The alias can be a maximum of eight characters; the first character
must be a lowercase letter.  Only one alias per user is allowed.  An
alias is particularly useful for a user with a long or complex name.


Arguments:
Person_id
   is the Person_id of the user whose login alias is to be changed.
alias
   is the new login alias of the user.  If this argument is omitted,
   the chalias command prints the user's old alias and waits for the
   accounting administrator to either enter the new one or enter a null
   line (to retain the old alias).

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
