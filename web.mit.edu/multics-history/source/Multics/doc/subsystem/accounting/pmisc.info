03/04/85 pmisc

Syntax as a command:  pmisc


Function:  prints the contents of the miscfile.  It is useful as a
check to be sure that all entries in the miscfile are correct before
the bills are run.  The accounting administrator can print the
miscellaneous charges and credits for an individual project or he can
print the entire miscfile.  He can also print the charges and credits
for specific dates.  The dates must be in the form mm/dd/yy or mm/dd.
If more than one date appears on the same line, they must be separated
by spaces.  Type "x" instead of a Project_id to exit from the command.


Notes:  The pmisc command first asks the accounting administrator to
enter the name of the project whose miscfile entries he wants to
review.  If the accounting administrator types "all" in response to
this request, the entries for all projects in the miscfile are printed.

The pmisc command then asks the accounting administrator to enter the
dates on which the charges to be reviewed were incurred.  If the
accounting administrator types "all" in response to this request, all
the entries in the miscfile are printed.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
