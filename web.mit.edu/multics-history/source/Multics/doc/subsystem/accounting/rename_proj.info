03/05/85 rename_proj

Syntax as a command:  rename_proj Project_id1 Project_id2
   {new_project_alias}


Function:  is used to rename a project.  It changes the project's name
in the SAT and installs it; it renames the system copy of the project's
PDT and changes the project name stored in that PDT; and it renames the
project directory.  If the project is not delegated, it renames and
edits the PMF and replaces it in the pmf.archive segment, deleting the
copy with the old name from the archive.

Note, the system administrator must set access on the segments
contained in the renamed project directory so that users on the renamed
project have access to them.


Arguments:
Project_id1
   is the Project_id of the project whose name is to be changed.
Project_id2
   is the new Project_id of the project.
new_project_alias
   is the new project alias, if it is to be changed.  If this argument
   is omitted, the old project alias, if any, is unchanged.


Notes:  To change the default project for users now on project AAA, the
system administrator can use the chdf_proj command (once for each
user).  If the accounting administrator does not change the users'
default projects, users with users' default projects AAA can change the
default project to BBB when they log in (by using the
-change_default_project control argument to the login command).

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
