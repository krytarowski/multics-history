03/04/85 new_proj

Syntax as a command:  new_proj Project_id


Function:  requests all project registration data, including the
initial list of users, and installs the new PDT and SAT.  The new_proj
command exits immediately and stops whatever it is doing when the
accounting administrator types "stop" in response to any question.  At
the end of input, the accounting administrator is asked if he wants to
review the data; if he replies "yes", all of the project registration
data are printed out.


Arguments:
Project_id
   is the Project_id of the project to be registered.  The Project_id
   must be from one to nine characters long, must begin with a capital
   letter or a digit, and must be unique at the site.


Notes:  If the system crashes during the new_proj command, the project
may have been incompletely added to the system.  If this happens, the
accounting administrator MUST NOT try to add the project again from the
beginning.  The help of a system administrator is necessary to complete
the adding of the project.  All terminal output should be saved and no
other project registrations attempted until a system administrator has
checked and corrected the files.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
