03/04/85 delegate

Syntax as a command:  delegate Project_id path User_id


Function:  gives a project administrator control over a project's PMF.
Once this is done, the project administrator can add and delete users
and set resource-usage limits on users in the project.  There may be up
to four project administrators for the project.

The delegate command edits the SAT to show that a project administrator
can install PDTs for a particular project.  It also sets access on the
proj_admin_seg segment (in the >sc1 directory) and the >sc1>update
directory so the project administrator can install his PDT.


A delegated project is under control of the project administrator only.
The accounting administrator receives an error message if he attempts
to execute the add_anon, dpmf, upmf, or pmf commands on a delegated
project.  The accounting administrator can use the undelegate command
if he wishes to take a project back from a project administrator, in
order to have the project under his control, or to delegate it to some
new project administrator.


Arguments:
Project_id
   is the Project_id of the project to be assigned a project
   administrator.
path
   is the pathname of the directory in which the PMF is placed.  This
   pathname is usually the pathname of the project directory.
User_id
   is the User_id, specified as Person_id.Project_id, of the project
   administrator.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
