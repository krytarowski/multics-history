Syntax as a command:  word login_word {message}


Function:  can be used to change either the login word or the dialup
buffer typed out when a user dials up, or both.  This command can be
used in ring 4 only.


Arguments:
login_word
   is a new login word that is set and must be given by users in order
   to log in.  If the login word is set to shutdown, no users are
   allowed to log in.  If a user dials up in this case, he is told that
   the system is shutting down, and his terminal is hung up
   immediately.
message
   is a message string to which the dialup buffer is set.  The message
   argument may be omitted; if it is, and if login_word is "login," the
   message buffer is reset; if login_word is "shutdown," the message
   buffer is set to "Multics is shutting down"; if login_word is
   anything else, the message buffer is set to "Special session in
   progress."

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
