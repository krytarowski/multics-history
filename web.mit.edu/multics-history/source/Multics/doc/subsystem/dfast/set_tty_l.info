03/11/76   set_tty, stty

Function:  The set_tty command specifies properties of the user's
terminal.  It is needed only in those rare cases when Multics does not
recognize the terminal being used at login.


Syntax:  set_tty {-control_args}


where control_args may be chosen from the following control arguments:

     -terminal_type XX,  causes the user's terminal type to be set
     -ttp XX	     to device type XX, where XX can be any one of
                         the following:

                         TTY37, tty37   device similar to Teletype
                                        Model 37
                         TTY33, tty33   device similar to Teletype
                                        Model 33 or 35
                         TTY38, tty38   device similar to Teletype
                                        Model 38
                         TN300, tn300   device similar to GE TermiNet
                                        300 or 1200

                         The default modes for the new terminal type
                         are turned on.

     -modes XX           sets the modes for terminal I/O according to
                         XX, which is a string of mode names separated
                         by commas, each one optionally preceded by "^"
                         to turn the specified mode off.  A subset of
                         modes the DFAST user may need to set are given
                         below.  Other modes are, however, supported.
                         A full set of modes is printed with the -print
                         control argument.  Valid mode names are:

                         ll_n            where _n is an integer
			          (10 <= N >= 255) specifying the
                                        length (in character positions)
                                        of a terminal line.
                         crecho,        crecho specifies that a
		     ^crecho        carriage return is to be echoed
				when the user types linefeed
				(^crecho turns this mode off).
                         lfecho,        lfecho specifies that a
		     ^lfecho        line feed is to
				be echoed when a carriage
                                        return is typed (^lfecho turns
                                        this mode off).
                         tabecho        specifies that the appropriate
		     ^tabecho       number of blanks are to be
				echoed when a tab is typed.

                         Modes not specified in XX are left unchanged.
                         See "Notes" below.

     -reset              turns off all modes that are not specifically
                         set by the default modes string for the
                         current terminal type.

     -tabs               specifies that the device has
                         software-settable tabs, and that the tabs are
                         to be set. This control argument currently has
                         effect only for GE TermiNet 300-like devices.

     -print              causes the terminal type and a complete set of
                         modes to be printed on the terminal. If any
                         other control arguments are specified, the
                         type and modes printed reflect the result of
                         the command.


Notes:

The set_tty command performs the following steps in the specified
order:


     1.   If the -terminal_type control argument is specified, set the
          specified device type and turn on the default modes for that
          type.

     2.   If the -reset control argument is specified, turn off all
          modes that are not set in the default modes string for the
          current terminal type.

     3.   If the -modes control argument is specified, turn on or off
          those modes explicitly specified.

     4.   If the -tabs control argument is specified, and the terminal
          has settable tabs, set the tabs.

     5.   If the -print control argument is specified, print the type
          and modes on the terminal.


Examples:

In the following example, a user of a TermiNet 300 with tabs
establishes his terminal type.


!    set_tty -terminal_type tn300 -tabs -reset


In the next example, the user wants to use the linefeed key on his
terminal for the newline character instead of the carriage return key.
After the change, the user will type linefeed and the terminal will
echo with carriage return so the carriage will be positioned for the
next line.


!    set_tty -modes crecho


In the next example the user changes the line length to 60 characters.
Lines that are longer than 60 characters will be continued on the
following line.  Lines that are continued will begin with "\c".


!    set_tty -modes ll60

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
