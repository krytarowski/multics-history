Function:  The list_acl command lists the access control lists (ACLs)
of files or directories.  (See "Access Control" in Section III of the
M__u_l_t_i_c_s D_F_A_S_T_ S__u_b_s_y_s_t_e_m U__s_e_r_s'_ G__u_i_d_e (Order No. AT59)).



Syntax:  list_acl {file_name} {User_ids} {-control_args}


where:

1.   file_name              identifies the file whose ACL is to be
                            listed.  If it is omitted, the home
                            directory is assumed and no User_ids can be
                            specified.  The star convention can be
                            used.

2.   User_ids               are access control names that must be of
                            the form Person_id.Project_id.tag.  All ACL
                            entries with matching names are listed.
                            (For a description of the matching
                            strategy, refer to the set_acl command.)
                            If User_id is -a, -all, or omitted, the
                            entire ACL is listed.

3.   control_args           can be chosen from the following control
                            arguments:

       -all, -a             lists the entire ACL.  This argument
                            overrides any specified User_ids.

       -brief, -bf          suppresses the message "User name not on
                            ACL of file/directory."

       -directory, -dr      lists the ACLs of directories only.  The
                            default is files and directories.


Note:

If the list_acl command is invoked with no arguments, it lists the
entire ACL of the home directory.


Example:

!    list_acl notice.runoff .Faculty. Doe


lists, from the ACL of notice.runoff, all entries with Project_id
Faculty and the entry for Doe.*.*.

!    list_acl *.basic


lists the whole ACL of every file in the home directory that has a
two-component name with a second component of basic.


!    la -wd .Faculty. *.*.*


lists access modes for all entries on the home directory's ACL whose
Project_id is Faculty and for the *.*.* entry.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
