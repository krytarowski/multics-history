03/11/76   delete_acl, da

Function:  The delete_acl command removes entries from the access
control lists (ACLs) of files.  (See "Access Control" in Section III
of the M__u_l_t_i_c_s D_F_A_S_T_ S__u_b_s_y_s_t_e_m U__s_e_r_s'_ G__u_i_d_e (Order No. AT59)).



Syntax:  delete_acl {file_name} {User_ids} {-control_args}


where:

1.   file_name          is the name of the file whose ACL is to be
                        deleted.  If it is omitted, only a User_id of
                        -all or -a is allowed.  The star convention can
                        be used.

2.   User_ids           are access control names that must be of the
                        form Person_id.Project_id.tag.  All ACL entries
                        with matching names are deleted.  (For a
                        description of the matching strategy, refer to
                        the set_acl command.)  If User_id is -a or
                        -all, the entire ACL is deleted with the
                        exception of an entry for *.SysDaemon.*.  If no
                        User_id is given, the user's Person_id and
                        Project_id are assumed.

3.   control_args       can be chosen from the following:

       -all, -a         causes the entire ACL to be deleted with the
                        exception of an entry for *.SysDaemon.*.

       -brief, -bf      suppresses the message "User name not on ACL."


Note:

An ACL entry for *.SysDaemon.* can be deleted only by specifying all
three components.  The user should be aware that in deleting access to
the SysDaemon project he prevents Backup.SysDaemon.* from saving the
segment or directory on tape, Dumper.SysDaemon.* from reloading it, and
Retriever.SysDaemon.* from retrieving it.


Example:

!    delete_acl news .Faculty. Jones


deletes from the ACL of news all entries with Project_id Faculty and
the entry for Jones.*.*.


!    da beta.** ..


deletes from the ACL of every file whose entryname has a first
component of beta all entries except the one for *.SysDaemon.*.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
