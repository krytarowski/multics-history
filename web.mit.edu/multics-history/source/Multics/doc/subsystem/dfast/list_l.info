03/11/76   list, lis; listnh, lisn

The list command displays information contained in the current file
alone, the alter file alone, or of the current file after merging with
the alter file.  In the latter case, the list command causes the merge
to take place thereby clearing the alter file.  The output from list is
preceded by a header giving the file name and the time and date.  To
suppress this header, the user may use listnh with the same type of
arguments.


Syntax:  list {file} {line_number}


where:

1.   file           identifies the file to be listed (current or
                    alter).

2.   line_number    is any valid line number.


The effects of the various uses of list are shown below:


     FORM                EFFECT

     list                prints the current file (after merging with
                         alter file).

     list line_number    prints the current file beginning at the line
                         number given; if no such line number exists,
                         the next higher line number is used; if the
                         line number is greater than any line number in
                         the file, the last line of the file is
                         printed.

     list current,       prints the current file (without  merging
     list cur            contents of alter file).

     list alter,         prints  contents  of  alter  file  after
     list alt            sorting into numerical order by line number
		     (lines containing only line numbers are
		     retained in this case).


A line number may be specified with either current or alter (e.g., list
alt 40).  The printout adheres to the rule given for the list
line_number form above but is restricted to the file specified.


Example:

The output of the listings below assumes the following contents for the
current and alter files.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
