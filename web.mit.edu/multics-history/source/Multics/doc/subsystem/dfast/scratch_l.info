03/11/76   scratch, scr

Function:  The scratch command empties either the current and alter
files or a saved file.  The current name and system are not affected.
If a saved file is scratched, its name is retained in the specified
directory but its contents are deleted.  In this case the current and
alter files are not affected.  To delete the name plus the contents,
the unsave command is used.


Syntax:  scratch {file_name}


where file_name is the name of a file saved in the home directory or
some other directory to which the user has deletion privileges.


Example:

!    tty
     name = test.basic,  system = basic,  user = Smith,  line = tty112
     ready  0730


!    scratch
     ready  0730


!    list current
     list:  current file is empty
     ready  0730


!    list alter
     list:  alter file is empty
     ready  0730


!    tty
     name = test.basic,  system = basic,  user = Smith,  line = tty112
     ready  0731

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
