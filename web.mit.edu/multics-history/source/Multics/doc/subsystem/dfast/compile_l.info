03/11/76   compile, com

Function:  The compile command compiles the current program into object
code by the BASIC or FORTRAN compiler.  The resultant object program
becomes the current file and can be executed immediately using the run
command or can be saved for subsequent execution.  The current file
must be saved before compilation.


The current name is changed, as follows, with respect to the source
program name.  If the source program name has a language suffix (e.g.,
prog.basic), the current name after compilation becomes the source name
with the suffix removed (e.g., prog).  If no suffix was used for the
source program (e.g., prog), the current name becomes "object."  If
errors are detected during compilation, error messages are issued by
the compiler and the source program is retained as the current file.


Syntax:  compile {system_name}


where system_name is basic, dbasic, or fortran.


If no argument is supplied, the current system is the value assumed.
For information on determining the current system, see "Current System"
in Section III of the M__u_l_t_i_c_s D_F_A_S_T_ S__u_b_s_y_s_t_e_m U__s_e_r_s'_ G__u_i_d_e (Order No. AT59).


Example:

!    rename test.basic
     ready  1100


!    compile
     compile: current segment must be saved
     ready  1100


!    save
     ready  1100


!    compile
     ready  1100


!    tty
     name = test,  system = basic,  user = Smith,  line = tty112

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
