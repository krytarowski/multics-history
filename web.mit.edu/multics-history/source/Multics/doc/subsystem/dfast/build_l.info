03/11/76   build, bui

Function:  The build command initiates an input mode for nonnumbered
lines of text that are appended directly to the current file.  Any text
in the alter file when build is given is merged before the new text is
appended.  (Notice that a DFAST command entered in this mode is simply
accepted as text.)  The build mode of input is terminated by typing a
line consisting of a newline.  When DFAST issues a ready message, the
normal command environment is restored.


Syntax:  build


Example:

!    new test
     ready  0925

!    build

!    save
!    replace
!    etcetera

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
