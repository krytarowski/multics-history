03/11/76   edit append, edit app

Function:  The append request combines two or more files specified by
the user.  Files are concatenated in the order specified without any
regard for their current line numbers.  The resultant file becomes the
current file and is resequenced with line numbers beginning at 100 and
incremented by 10 to derive subsequent numbers.  For BASIC programs (if
the system name is basic or dbasic), internal references to changed
line numbers are also changed.  This means that lines in one file
should not refer to line numbers in another file.


Syntax:  edit append file1 file2{ file3 ... fileN}


where each filei is a file name; at least two files must be specified.


Example:

!    new newfile.basic
     ready  1101


!    10  read x
!    20  if x=0  goto 10
!    30  print x
!    save
     ready  1101


!    new subr.basic
     ready  1101


!    10  read y
!    20  if y=0 goto 10
!    30  print y
!    40  end
!    save
     ready  1102


!    edit append newfile.basic subr.basic
     ready  1102


!    lisn
     100 read x
     110 if x=0 goto 100
     120 print x
     130 read y
     140 if y=0 goto 130
     150 print y
     160 end
     ready  1102

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
