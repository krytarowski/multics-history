Function:  The old command retrieves a file that has previously been
saved either in the user's home directory or another directory to which
the user has access.  If the retrieval is successful, the saved file
replaces the current file and the alter file is cleared.  If the saved
file's name includes a language component, the system is changed to
that language.  Otherwise, the message "enter system:" is printed and
the user can type basic, dbasic, or fortran.


Syntax:  old {file_name} {system_name}

where:


1.   file_name      is the name of a saved file; if it is not supplied,
                    DFAST requests that the user type it in.

2.   system_name    sets the current system to basic, dbasic, or
                    fortran.


Example:

!    system basic
     ready  0102


!    old
     enter name: ! test.basic
     ready  0102


!    old tst.fortran
     system changed to fortran
     ready  0103


!    tty
     name=tst.fortran,  system=fortran,  user=Smith.Des,  line=tty112
     ready  0103


!    old >udd>Faculty>Jones>test.basic
     system changed to basic
     ready  0103


!    tty
     name=tst.basic,  system=basic,  user=Smith.Des,  line=tty112
     ready  0103

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
