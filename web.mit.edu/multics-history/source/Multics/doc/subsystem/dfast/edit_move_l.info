03/12/76   edit move, edit mov

Function:  The move request relocates specified lines within the
current file to a given location.  Relocated lines are placed after a
specified line number and assigned new line numbers by incrementing
that value by one.  For example, if three lines are moved to line 100,
they will be given the line numbers 101, 102, and 103.  If a sequence
of lines is moved so that their numbers would not fit between the line
specified and the line originally specified, succeeding lines are
resequenced with an increment of one until there is no overlap.


Syntax:  edit move line1 line2


where:

1.   line1          is a line or range of lines to be moved.

2.   line2          is the line after which line1 will be inserted.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
