03/12/76   edit insert, edit ins

Function:  The insert request inserts files at given points in a
specified file.  The final result becomes the current file and is
resequenced beginning with line number 100 and incremented by 10 to
derive subsequent numbers.  For BASIC programs (if the system name is
basic or dbasic), internal references to changed line numbers are also
changed.


Syntax:  edit insert file1 file2 line1{ file3 line2 ... fileN lineN}


where:

1.   file1          is the file into which information is inserted.

2.   file2...fileN  are files to be inserted.

3.   line1...lineN  are line numbers in file1 after which the
                    associated files are to be inserted.


Example:

!    new file1
     ready  1300


!    10  This is
!    20  new text
!    30  and this
!    save
     ready  1300


!    new file2
     ready  1300


!    10  to be inserted
!    20  in file1
!    save
     ready  1301


!    new file3
     ready  1301


!    10  is also
!    20  inserted
!    save
     ready  1301


     edit insert file1 file2 20 file3 30
     ready  1301

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
