03/12/76   edit locate, edit loc

Function:  The locate request causes the current file to be searched
for all occurrences of a specified text string.  Each line containing a
match for the string is printed.  If line number arguments are
supplied, the search is restricted to the lines given; otherwise the
entire file is searched.


Syntax:  edit locate /text_string/{line1 line2 ... lineN}


where:

1.   /              is the string delimiter.  Any character except
                    blank or tab can be used as the string delimiter so
                    long as it does not appear in the string itself.

2.   text_string    is the string of characters to be matched; any
                    character (including blank) except the delimiter
                    may be used.

3.   linei          is a single line or range of lines.


Example:

!    new sample
     ready  0707


!    210 if m>n then 260
!    220 next i
!    230 if n<>m then 260
!    240 print "ok"
!    250 stop
!    260 go to 100
!    edit locate />/
     210 if m>n then 260

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
