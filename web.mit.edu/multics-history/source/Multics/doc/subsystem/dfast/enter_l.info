These requests are used by anonymous users to gain access to DFAST.
Either one is actually a request to the answering service to create a
process for the anonymous user.  See also the login command.


Anonymous users who are not to supply a password use the enter (e)
request.  Anonymous users who are to supply a password use the enterp
(ep) request.


Syntax:  enter {anonymous_name} Project_id {-control_args}



where:

1.   anonymous_name           is an optional identifier that is not
                              checked by the Multics system, but is
                              treated as if it were a person
                              identifier.

2.   Project_id               is the identification of the user's
                              project, which is registered by the
                              Multics system administrator.

3.   control_args             can be chosen from the following list of
                              control arguments:

       -brief, -bf            suppresses messages associated with a
                              successful login.

       -no_print_off, -npf    overtypes a string of characters to
                              provide a black area for the user to type
                              his password; necessary only for
                              terminals not equipped to suppress

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
