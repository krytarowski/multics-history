03/11/76   dprint, dp

Function:  The dprint command queues specified files for printing on
the line printer.  The output begins with a header sheet that is
identified by the requestor's User_id and, if specified, the
destination.  A summary sheet indicates the time of the request, the
time of printing, the number of lines and pages printed, and the cost
of printing.


Syntax:  dprint {-control_args} {file1 file2 ... fileN}


where:

1.   control_args                   may be chosen from the following
                                    list of control arguments and can
                                    appear anywhere in the command
                                    line:

       -header XX, -he XX           identifies subsequent output by the
                                    string XX.  If this control
                                    argument is not given, the default
                                    is the requestor's Person_id.  This
                                    argument can be overruled by a
                                    subsequent -header control
                                    argument.

       -destination XX, -ds XX      labels subsequent output with the
                                    string XX, which is used to
                                    determine where to deliver the
                                    output.  If this control argument
                                    is not given, the default is the
                                    requestor's Project_id.  This
                                    argument can be overruled by a
                                    subsequent -destination control
                                    argument.

       -map                         prints a file using only uppercase
                                    letters.  See "Notes" below.

2.   filei                          each filei is the name of a file to
                                    be queued for printing.


Notes:

The dprint command, invoked without any arguments, prints a message
telling how many requests are in the queue for printing.


If control arguments are present, they affect only files specified
after their appearance in the command line.  If control arguments are
given without a following filei argument, they are ignored for this
invocation of the command and a warning message is returned.


If the -map control argument is used, an uppercase version of the
user's file is created in his home directory with the name
"file_name.map".  After printing, it is deleted.  Only one file can be
printed by dprint when the -map control argument is supplied.


Example:

!    dp -he Jones test.basic test.fortran


causes a copy of each of the files named test.basic and test.fortran in
the home directory to be printed with the header "Jones".

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
