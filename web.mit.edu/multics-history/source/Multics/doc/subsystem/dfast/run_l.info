03/11/76   run

Function:  The run command causes the current file to be executed.  The
file must begin with a main program.  It may be in source or object
form.  If the current file is an object program, it will be directly
executed.  If the system_name argument is supplied, the current system
is changed accordingly.  The contents of the current file are
unaffected.


If the current file (or any external subprogram file that it calls) is
in source form, it is compiled to produce a temporary object program,
which is then executed.  An external file must have been specified in a
BASIC or FORTRAN library statement within the user's program.


Syntax:  run {system_name}


where system_name can be basic, dbasic, or fortran.


Example:

!    old test.basic
     ready  907


!    run
     Your program types this
     when it runs.
     ready  907

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
