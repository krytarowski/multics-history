03/12/76   edit resequence, edit res

Function:  The resequence request renumbers specified lines in the
current file, beginning with a given line number and adding a given
increment to derive subsequent numbers.  If only a beginning line is
given, resequencing continues to the end of the file.  If a range of
lines is given, resequencing terminates at the upper bound of the
range.  If no argument is given, the default assumption is to begin
renumbering at the beginning of the file (denoted by 0), to assign 100
as the first line number, and to derive subsequent numbers in
increments of 10.  For BASIC programs (if the system name is basic or
dbasic), internal references to changed line numbers are also changed.


Syntax:

edit resequence {new_num, start_line, inc}

edit resequence new_num, range, inc


where:

1.   new_num        is the first new line number to be assigned (100 by
                    default).

2.   start_line     is the line to which new_num is to be assigned (0
                    by default).

3.   inc            is the increment used to derive subsequent line
                    numbers (10 by default).

4.   range          is a range of lines delimiting the resequencing
                    operation.


Example:

!    new newfile
     ready  1301

!    210 if m>n then 260
!    220 next i
!    230 if n<>m then 260
!    240 print "ok"
!    250 stop
!    260 go to 400
!    edit resequence
     ready  1301

!    lisn
     100 if m>n then 150
     110 next i
     120 if n<>m then 150
     130 print "ok"
     140 stop
     150 go to 400
     ready  1301

!    edit resequence 210 110-130 5
     ready  1302


!    lisn
     100 if m>n then 150
     210 next i
     215 if n<>m then 150
     220 print "ok"
     140 stop
     150 go to 400
     ready  1302

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
