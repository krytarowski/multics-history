03/11/76   sort, sor

Function:  The sort command arranges the current file in ascending
sequence by line number.  When more than one line has the same line
number, the last one is retained.  Lines that are not numbered are
deleted.  Text in the alter file is merged before the sort is executed.
Since normal line-numbered input is automatically sorted, the sort
command is applicable only to files that have been created in some
other way (such as by a user program execution or with the build
command).


Syntax:  sort


Example:

!    old results
     ready  0915


!    lisn
     100 new data
     entered for
     100 a user
     program
     120 a user's
     130 program
     10  This is

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
