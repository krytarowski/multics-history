03/12/76   edit sequence, edit seq

Function:  The sequence request adds a new set of line numbers to the
current file, beginning with a given line number and adding a given
increment to derive subsequent numbers.  If the file already has line
numbers, these are retained but become part of the text on the line.
If no increment is supplied, 10 is assumed.  If no arguments are
supplied, the first line number in the file will be 100.


Syntax:  edit sequence {first_num inc}


where:

1.   first_num      is the first line number (100 by default).

2.   inc            is the increment used to derive subsequent numbers
                    (10 by default).


Example:

!    build
!    nonnumbered
!    file
!    input
!

     ready  1503


!    edit sequence
     ready  1503


!    lisn
     100 nonnumbered
     110 file
     120 input
     ready  1503


!    edit sequence 500 5
     ready  1504


!    lisn
     500 100 nonnumbered
     505 110 file
     510 120 input
     ready  1504

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
