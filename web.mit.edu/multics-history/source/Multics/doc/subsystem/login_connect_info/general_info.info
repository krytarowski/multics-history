03/04/87  Connecting to an Existing Process

You are logged in but your terminal is not connected to a process.  You
either have disconnected processes but did not say what to do with
them, or you have no disconnected processes but tried to connect or
destroy a disconnected process.  In either case, you must now indicate
what you want to do by means of one of the following requests.


List of connection requests:
create
   creates a process (note that you need permission to have more than
   one interactive process at a time).
connect {N}
   connects your terminal to a disconnected process.  Use this request
   to resume your work at the point where your terminal got
   disconnected from your process.
destroy {N} {-control_args}
   connects your terminal to a disconnected process and then logs it
   (and you) out immediately.  Use this request so an unwanted
   disconnected process will not continue to incur charges and exclude
   other users from the system.
list
   lists your disconnected processes.


logout {-control_args}
   logs you out without affecting any process.  Use this request if you
   leave the terminal dialed up while logged in and not connected, to
   avoid giving the terminal's next user your access privileges.
new_proc {N} {-control_args}
   connects your terminal to a disconnected process after doing a
   new_proc.  Use this request to resume your work from a convenient
   point in a new process if your old process was malfunctioning.


Notes: The optional process numbers, indicated by {N} after several of
the requests, are to be used if you have more than one disconnected
process.  The list request lists your disconnected processes and
assigns numbers to them.


Other requests:  Several requests are available when connecting to a
process.

Type "?" for a list of available requests.
Type "list_requests" for a short description of the requests.
Type "list_help" for a list of topics available to the help request.
Type "help TOPIC" for more information on a given topic.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
