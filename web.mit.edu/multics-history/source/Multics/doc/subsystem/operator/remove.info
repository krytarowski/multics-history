02/18/85 remove

Syntax as a command:  remove channel_id1 {channel_id2 ...  channel_idN}


Function:  controls communications channels for login, slave, autocall,
or ftp service.  Specifically, it directs the answering service to stop
using specified channels or making them available.  Any user logged in
on one of these channels is logged out immediately with no message.
This command can be used in ring 4 only.


Arguments:
channel_idi
   are the names of the channels to be removed.  (See the Multics
   System Maintenance Procedures manual, Order No.  AM81, for
   information on channel names.)  The channel_id arguments may be
   either terminal channel names or network channel names.


Notes:  The remove command sometimes succeeds where bump and detach
fail, because it uses different mechanisms for destroying the user's
process.  This command should not be used unless the user complains of
channel trouble and cannot be bumped.  Once a channel is removed, the
telephone associated with the channel will not answer and the channel
cannot be used for logins again until an attach command reattaches it
to the answering service.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
