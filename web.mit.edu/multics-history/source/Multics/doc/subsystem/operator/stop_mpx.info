02/21/85 stop_mpx

Syntax as a command:  stop_mpx name


Function:  causes the specified multiplexer to be made inactive.  This
makes the multiplexer stop listening for further calls on its dialup
channels if it is up and running; it inhibits listening to the channels
after a bootload, if one is in progress; it prevents automatic
reloading of the multiplexer if it crashes (or is crashed by the
dump_mpx command); and if issued before startup, it prevents the
loading of the multiplexer during startup.  Users currently logged in
over the multiplexer channels are not affected.  This command can be
used in ring 4 only.


Arguments:
name
   specifies the multiplexer that is to be made inactive.


Notes:  To bump all users logged in over channels of this multiplexer
(see the bump command for more information), type:

   !  stop_mpx name
   !  bump mpx name {mm} {message}

This sequence of the two commands stop_mpx and bump mpx is the
recommended method of taking a multiplexer out of service while Multics
remains up.

Hardwired channels normally appear to be dialed up at all times; such
channels are not affected by the stop_mpx command.


The effect of the stop_mpx command can be reversed by issuing the
start_mpx command, provided that the multiplexer remains running during
the time it is out of service.  If it does not remain running, the
load_mpx command must be used to return it to service.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
