02/13/85 cripple

Syntax as a command:  cripple


Function:  prepares for a hierarchy reload operation that reloads the
system library directories or the initializer's directory
>system_control_1.

To do such a hierarchy reload, bring up a special session and log in a
daemon process to be used for reloading (e.g., Dumper.SysDaemon).  The
message coordinator should not be used during such a reload, since its
programs and data bases are likely to be replaced by the reload, too.
(See the no_start command.)  This command can be used only in ring 4.


Notes:  After the reloader is logged in, the cripple command is typed
to shut off the answering service so that no unexpected faults will
occur if one of the answering service data bases or programs is deleted
by the reloader.

When the reload is done, do not attempt to shut down, as this is likely
to cause a fault.  Instead, reenter BCE with the bce command or from
the processor panel.  (A reset command resets the effect of cripple,
but is not recommended.)

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
