02/21/85 start_mpx

Syntax as a command:  start_mpx name


Function:  causes a multiplexer that is already initialized (loaded) to
be made active, and all channels configured on it to be listened to.
This command can be used after a load_mpx command that was issued with
the -no_start argument, or after a stop_mpx command, to reverse the
effect of the latter command.  For a multiplexer that is not
initialized, the load_mpx command must be issued before the start_mpx
command.  This command can be used in ring 4 only.


Arguments:
name
   designates the multiplexer that is to be activated.  All the
   channels in the CDT that match the starname name.** will be listened
   to.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
