02/13/85 bump

Syntax as a command:  bump target {mm} {message}


Function:  logs out a user at a specified time.  It does this by
causing the initializer to signal itself to bump the user.  If the
initializer is operating improperly and cannot handle logins, bump
probably will not operate properly either.  This command can be used
only in ring 4.


Arguments:
target
   must be one of the following listed below.
   Person_id Project_id, Person_id.Project_id
      bumps the user with the specified name and project.  The star
      convention may be used for either or both names.  Users with the
      nobump privilege are sent a message informing them that an
      attempt to bump them has been made.
   channel_id
      bumps the user on the channel whose name is channel_id.  These
      names can be either terminal or network channel names.  This
      argument overrides the nobump attribute.  See the Multics System
      Maintenance Procedures manual, Order No.  AM81, for information
      on channel names.


   mpx NAME
      bumps all users whose terminals are connected through the
      multiplexer specified by NAME.  The NAME argument must be the
      name of a multiplexer or an FNP.
mm
   is the number of minutes to elapse, after which the user is bumped.
   If MM is omitted, the user is bumped immediately.
message
   is a string that is typed on the user's terminal.  If message is
   omitted, the user is not told why he is being bumped.


Notes:  Sometimes, the bump command appears to work -- the message
"Person_id.Project_id bumped" is printed -- but the user is not logged
out.  If this happens, try the remove command on the user's terminal
channel.

See the abs bump and abs cancel commands for instructions on bumping
absentee users.  See the logout command for instructions on logging out
daemon processes.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
