03/15/85 repair

Syntax as a command:  x repair key dir nprocs {salvager_arguments}


Function:  starts (or stops) a multiprocess hierarchy repair.  The
repair can consist of an online directory salvage, a quota_used
correction, or both.  The repair may be performed over the entire
hierarchy or any subtree.  Up to 36 Salvager.SysDaemon processes may
participate in the repair, so that it is completed as rapidly as
possible.  This command should only be used at the direction of the
system administrator or the system programmers.


Arguments:
key
   can be one of the following:
   salv
      performs a directory salvage
   quota
      performs a quota_used correction
   salvquota
      performs both
   stop
      stops a repair that is in progress


dir
   is the directory at the top of the subtree to be repaired.
nprocs
   is the number of processes to be used (1 to 36).
salvager_arguments
   are arguments acceptable to the salvag_dir command.  The default is
   the single argument, -compact.


Notes:  Any of these operations automatically collates and sorts all
output, and dprints the result to "SALV-OUTPUT" and "SALV-ONLINE",
being salvager output and online error messages and quota_corrections,
respectively.  The outputs are kept in the directory
>udd>SysDaemon>Salvager, and automatically deleted when they become two
weeks old.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
