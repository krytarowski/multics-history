02/13/85 disconnect

Syntax as a command:  disconnect target


Function:  hangs up a login-service communications channel.  This
typically results in the user process entering the disconnected state,
which allows the user to log in again and reconnect to the process.  If
the user is not allowed to have disconnected processes or has disabled
disconnection service for the process, it is logged out.  The command
can be used when part of the communications network has broken down
without informing Multics.  For example, if a foreign terminal
concentrator crashes, it is possible for Multics to still treat the
communication lines as dialed-up.

The disconnect command causes the initializer to send a signal to
itself to hang up the specified channel.  If the initializer or Multics
communications software is malfunctioning, disconnect will probably not
operate properly either.  This command can be used in ring 4 only.


Arguments:
target
   must be one of the following.
   Person_id Project_id, Person_id.Project_id
      disconnects the login channel for the user with the specified
      name and project.  The star convention may be used for either or
      both names.
   channel_id
      disconnects the user on the channel whose name is channel_id.
      These names can be either terminal or network channel names.  See
      the Multics System Maintenance Procedures manual, Order No.
      AM81, for information on channel names.


   mpx name
      disconnects all users whose terminals are connected through the
      multiplexer specified by name.  The name argument must be the
      name of a multiplexer or an FNP.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
