02/12/85  add_vol, av

Syntax as a command:  av pv_name drive_name


Function:  tells the system that a physical volume is on a disk drive.
The system then reads and checks the volume label.  This command can be
used in ring 1 or ring 4.


Arguments:
pv_name
   is the name of a physical volume.
drive_name
   has the form <subsys>_<nn>, e.g., dska_02, or it may be -all to
   cause the system to read and check the labels of all assumed
   physical volumes.


Notes:  The registration file for volume_name is consulted to find out
the logical volume name and to validate the label.  The volume label is
read and checked.  If the label is correct the drive is left in the
known state.

If an add_lv command for the logical volume containing this physical
volume has been previously issued, and if this add_vol command
completes the logical volume, the logical volume is accepted for paging
and a message is printed.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
