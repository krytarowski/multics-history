Syntax as a command:  accept channel_id {restrict} {target} {bclist}


Function:  accepts a terminal device channel and connects it to the
message coordinator's device complement.  This command cannot be used
on multiplexer channels.  This command can be used only in ring 4.


Arguments:
channel_id
   is the name of a communications channel that must be listed with
   "service:  mc;" in the CMF, or be dialed up by a user who has issued
   the dial system or slave commands.  (See the Multics System
   Maintenance Procedures manual, Order No.  AM81, for information on
   channel names.)
restrict
   may be any of the following.
   full
      the device is able to issue all initializer commands.  This is
      the default.
   none
      no commands allowed.


   reply
      only reply is allowed.
   query
      only who and hmu are allowed.
   daemon
      only reply, intercom, and exec allowed.
target
   if specified, is a source name that is the only source name
   permitted for reply commands issued from channel_id.  This parameter
   is used for terminals dedicated to the control of a single I/O
   daemon.  The default name is *.


bclist
   if specified, it is a "broadcast list."  This list gives the
   channels that will have copies of input from channel_id, in the
   form shown below.

         (input on channel_id) r cd1 hello

   bclist may be

         none                for no broadcasting
         all                 to broadcast to all others
         a.l111,a.h102       to broadcast to the given list

   Output is never broadcast back to the inputting channel.


Notes:  Response:  channel_id attached by system control.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
