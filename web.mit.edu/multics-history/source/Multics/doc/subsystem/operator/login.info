02/13/85  login, logi

Syntax as a command:  logi daemon_user_id source {-control_args}


Function:  causes the login of a daemon process at the user's request.
This command can be used in ring 4 only.


Arguments:
daemon_user_id
   logs in the user whose name is specified by daemon_user_id as a
   daemon.  The daemon user's name may be given in either of these
   forms.

         Person_id.Project_id
         Person_id Project_id

   The user whose name is specified by daemon_user_id must have the
   daemon attribute.
source
   is the name of the input source, used in the reply command to direct
   terminal input to this process.


Control arguments:  may be chosen from those available with the login
access request, which is documented in the Multics Commands and
Active Functions manual, Order No.  AG92.  Those appropriate for use
in this context are listed here:
-arguments STR, -ag STR
   supplies arguments to the process.  STR can be one or more
   arguments.  All arguments following -ag on the command line are
   taken as arguments to the process.  Therefore -ag, if present, must
   be the last control argument on the login command line.  The process
   may determine the number and value of each argument with the user
   active function, described in the Multics Commands and Active
   Functions manual, Order No.  AG92.


-authorization STR, -auth STR
   sets the authorization of the process to that specified by STR,
   where STR is a character string composed of level and category names
   for the desired authorization, separated by commas.  The STR
   character string cannot contain any embedded blank or tab
   characters.  (The short names for each level and category are
   guaranteed to not contain any blanks or tabs, and can be used
   whenever the corresponding long names do contain blanks or tabs.)
   The STR character string must represent an authorization that is
   less than or equal to the maximum authorization of Person_id on the
   project Project_id.  If this control argument is omitted, the
   daemon's registered default login authorization is used.  (See
   Access Control in the Multics Programmerg's Reference manual, Order
   No.  AG91, for more information about process authorizations.)


-brief, -bf
   suppresses messages associated with a successful login.  If the
   standard process overseer is being used, the message of the day is
   not printed.
-change_default_auth, -cda
   changes the daemon's registered default login authorization to the
   authorization specified by the -authorization control argument.  If
   the authorization given by the user is valid, the default
   authorization is changed for subsequent logins, and the message
   "default authorization changed" is printed at the terminal.  If the
   -cda control argument is given without the -auth control argument,
   an error message is printed.
-home_dir path, -hd path
   sets the daemon's home directory to the path specified, if the
   daemon's project administrator allows this choice.


-no_start_up, -ns
   instructs the standard process overseer not to execute the daemon's
   start_up.ec segment, if one exists, and if the project administrator
   allows this choice.
-outer_module path, -om path
   attaches the daemon's terminal via the outer module named path
   rather than the daemon's registered outer module, if the daemon is
   allowed this choice.


-process_overseer path, -po path
   sets the daemon's process overseer to the procedure given by the
   path specified, if the daemon's project administrator allows this
   choice.  If path ends in the characters ",direct", the specified
   procedure is called directly during process initialization rather
   than by the standard procedure provided by the system.  This means
   that the program specified by path must perform the tasks that would
   have been performed by the standard procedure.
-ring N, -rg N
   sets the daemon's initial ring to be ring N, if this ring number is
   greater than or equal to the daemon's registered initial ring and
   less than the daemon's registered maximum ring.


Notes:  It should be noted that most daemon logins don't need any
control arguments, and are often taken care of by the admin.ec or the
system_start_up.ec.

The login command is used to cause a daemon process to be logged in
without a terminal of its own; such a process sends all its output via
the message routing DIM to the message coordinator for output on one of
the message coordinator's output destinations, and all input to such a
daemon process must be done via the initializer command reply.  (See
the reply command later in this section.)

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
