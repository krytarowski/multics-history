Syntax as a command:  x exec_command {arguments}


Function:  executes operator commands implemented in the segment
>sc1>admin.ec.  The version of admin.ec distributed with the system
implements a number of commands that have been found to be generally
useful.  These are listed below and described fully in Section 5.

A site may wish to modify these commands, or to implement new operator
commands, to meet the needs of the site.  This can be done by making
changes or additions to >sc1>admin.ec.  It is recommended that these
changes and additions be documented by the site, by adding or replacing
pages in Section 5 in the copies of this manual that are used by
operations personnel.  This command can be used in ring 4 only.


The effect of the exec command is as if the command had been typed in
admin mode.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
