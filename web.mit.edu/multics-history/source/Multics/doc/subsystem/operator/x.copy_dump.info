03/15/85 copy_dump

Syntax as a command:  copy_dump


Function:  copy a dump image taken by BCE out of the DUMP partition
into the Multics hierarchy.  It creates as many segments (up to ten) in
>dumps as necessary to hold the dump image.


Notes:  The name of each segment has the form:

      mmddyy.tttt.s.eee

where:
mmddyy
   is the date the dump was taken.
tttt
   is the time the dump was taken.
s
   is a sequence number (0, 1, 2, ...  9).
nnnn
   is the dump number assigned when recording this dump.


:Entries:  set_fdump_num:  03/15/85 copy_dump$set_fdump_num,
copy_dump$sfdn


Function:  This entry point sets the value of the next dump to be taken
by changing the value associated with the dump number in the DUMP
partition.


Syntax:  copy_dump$sfdn dmpno


Arguments:
dmpno
   is the dump number for the next dump to be taken.


Access required:  This command interfaces to hphcs_$copy_fdump and to
hphcs_$set_fdump_num and requires access to hphcs_.


Notes:  The DUMP parition is modified only after the last dump taken
has been copied.  If an attempt is made to change the dump number
before a dump has been copied, an error message is returned.

This command does not allow a particular dump to be copied twice;
therefore, it will return an error code if an attempt is made to recopy
a dump.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
