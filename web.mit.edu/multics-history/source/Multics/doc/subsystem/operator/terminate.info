02/21/85  terminate, term

Syntax as a command:  term target {message}


Function:  causes the initializer to destroy a user's process and
create a new one.  It has the effect of a new_proc command given in the
user's process.  If the user's process is not currently connected to a
terminal, it is logged out.  This command can be used in ring 4 only.


Arguments:
target
   must be one of the following:
   Person_id.Project_id, Person_id Project_id
      terminates the user with the specified name and project.  The
      star convention may be used for either or both names.
   channel_id
      terminates the user on the channel whose name is channel_id.
      These names can be either terminal channel names or network
      channel names.  (See the Multics System Maintenance Procedures
      manual, Order No.  AM81, for information on channel names.)


   mpx name
      terminates all users whose terminals are connected through the
      multiplexer specified by name.  The name argument must be the
      name of a multiplexer or an FNP.
message
   is the message string that is printed on the user's terminal.


Notes:  The terminate command is only to be used if the user requests
that his process be terminated.  This command can be used to bump a
user whose process is not currently connected to a terminal, even if
the user's process has the "nobump" attribute.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
