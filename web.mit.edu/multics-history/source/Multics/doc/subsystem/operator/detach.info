02/13/85 detach

Syntax as a command:  detach target {message}


Function:  prevents the answering service from listening for calls on a
channel.  Any user logged in on the channel is bumped.  This is done by
signalling as with the bump command.  This command can be used in ring
4 only.


Arguments:
target
   must be one of the following.
   Person_id Project_id, Person_id.Project_id
      to detach the user with the specified name and project.  The star
      convention may be used for either or both names.
   channel_id
      detaches the user on the channel whose name is channel_id.  These
      names can be either terminal or network channel names.  See the
      Multics System Maintenance Procedures manual, Order No.  AM81,
      for information on channel names.


   mpx name
      detaches all users whose terminals are connected through the
      multiplexer specified by name.  The name argument must be the
      name of a multiplexer or an FNP.
message
   is the string that is typed on the user's terminal.  If message is
   omitted, the user is not told what is happening.


Notes:  If the message "channel_id detached" is printed, then the
detach has been signalled.  If the user on the channel does not log out
shortly, try the remove command.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
