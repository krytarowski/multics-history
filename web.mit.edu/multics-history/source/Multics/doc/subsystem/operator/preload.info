02/18/85 preload

Syntax as a command:  preload device_name volume_name -control_arg


Function:  informs the system that a tape volume is to be preloaded on
a specified device for a certain user.  This allows you to load tapes
in advance when the needs of a user are known.  This command can be
used in ring 4 only.


Arguments:
device_name
   is the name of the device on which the volume is to be preloaded.
volume_name
   is the name of the volume to be preloaded.


Control arguments:
-user STR
   where STR is the name of the user for whom this preload is being
   performed.  This is a string of the form Person_id.Project_id.tag.


Notes:  This command only informs the system of your intention to
preload a particular volume on a specified device for a user.  It does
not check the loading of the proper volume on the device.  This label
checking is done at attach time.

Use of the preload command does not preserve the preloaded device.  The
preloaded volume may be automatically unloaded if another user of the
system requests a mount of a different volume on the preloaded device.

The user name specified may contain fields that match any string.
These are specified by the use of an asterisk (*) in the appropriate
field.  For example, the user name "*.Proj.*" will match any user on
the project Proj.  Also, missing trailing fields are assumed to be *.
For example, "*.Proj" also matches any user in the Proj project.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
