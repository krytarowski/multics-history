02/18/85 shift

Syntax as a command:  shift
or
shift {shift_number} {time}
or
shift auto


Function:  sets and prints the shift and the time of the next scheduled
shift change.  It should be used at the direction of the system
administrator, to override the values in the shift table.  This command
can be used in ring 4 only.


Arguments:
shift_number
   is the number of the shift to change to.  The shift_number argument
   must be a number in the range 0-7, and must also be one of the
   shifts normally used at the site, for which billing rates are
   defined in installation_parms.
time
   is the time of the next shift change.  It is a clock reading,
   acceptable to the convert_date_to_binary_ subroutine.  If time
   contains spaces it must be enclosed in quotes.  The time argument
   may be no more than one week in the future.
auto
   is a literal string that causes the system to use the value of the
   shift and the shift change time specified in the shift table.


Notes:  When the system is started up, a shift command from a previous
bootload remains in effect until the specified time.

To change the shift without changing the time, type

   !  shift shift_number

To change the shift and the shift change time to the regularly
scheduled values (specified in the shift table), type:

   !  shift auto


To cause the shift and the next shift change time to be displayed,
type:

   !  shift

The message

      shift  shift_number  until  time

is printed in response to all three forms of the shift command.  If the
shift or the time have been changed, their new values are displayed.


The best time to execute the shift command is shortly (about one
minute) before a regularly scheduled shift change.  If the shift
command must be executed in the middle of a shift, then notice should
be given by executing it at the beginning of that shift, using the
regular shift number and the time of the anticipated unscheduled shift
change.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
