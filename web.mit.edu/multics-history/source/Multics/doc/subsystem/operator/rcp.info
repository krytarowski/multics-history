Syntax as a command:  rcp keyword {-control_args}


Function:  lists resources controlled by the resource control package
(RCP), or cancels a reservation.  This command can be used in ring 4
only.


Arguments:
keyword
   must be one of the following:
   list
      lists resources controlled by RCP.  This keyword may be used with
      any control arguments except -id.  If used without control
      arguments, all resources are listed.
   cancel
      cancels the specified reservation.  This keyword must be used
      with both the -id and the -user control arguments.


Control arguments:
-device STR, -dv STR
   specifies the name of one device to be listed.
-id STR
   specifies the ID of the reservation to be cancelled.  This control
   argument must be used in conjunction with the cancel keyword.
-long, -lg
   specifies that all of the information known about each device listed
   is printed.  If this argument is not specified, only the state of
   the device, the time the device was put into that state, the process
   group ID of the process that has the device assigned, and any volume
   mounted on the device are printed.  If this argument is specified,
   then all of the characteristics of each device are printed.  Also,
   for each device type listed all of the per device type information
   is printed.


-mounts, -mnt
   lists pending mount requests for the device or devices specified.
   If the -long control argument is given with -mounts, the process
   name and write-protect status of the mount requests listed are
   listed as well.
-reserved, -resv
   lists information for all reservations known at this time, including
   the reservation ID, for the devices specified.
-type STR, -tp STR
   specifies the type of resource to be listed.  Currently, only device
   types are allowed.  The following device type names are valid:
   tape_drive, disk_drive, console, printer, punch, reader, and
   special.


-unattached, -unat
   lists names of all loaded, unattached volumes.
-user STR
   specifies the group ID of the user whose reservation is to be

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
