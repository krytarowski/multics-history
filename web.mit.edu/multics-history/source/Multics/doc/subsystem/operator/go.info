02/13/85 go

Syntax as a command:  go


Function:  initializes all channels attached to the answering service
so that they answer the phone.  It is the second half of startup.
Typing multics and then go is similar to startup except that the login
word is set to a random number, so only users who know the special word
can log in.  The go command initializes all lines in the channel
definition table (CDT).  Parts two and three of the system_start_up.ec
are executed in response to a go command.  Part two (the logging in of
the daemons) is done before user lines are conditioned for answering;
part three (commands executed after the phone lines are conditioned for
answering) is done afterward.  This command can be used in ring 4 only.


Notes:  A check is made to see if a down command has previously been
issued.  If one is found, and more than 30 minutes remain before it
takes effect, the down command is reissued automatically.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
