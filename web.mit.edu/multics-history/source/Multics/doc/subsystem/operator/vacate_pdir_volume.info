02/21/85 vacate_pdir_volume

Syntax as a command:  vacate_pdir_volume lv_1 lv_2...  lv_N
   {-control_args}


Function:  forces perprocess segments (segments in process directories)
off of the specified logical volumes.  These segments are spread evenly
over the remaining volumes in the PDIR volume set.  Before this
operation begins, all volumes specified to this command are inhibited
from having any more perprocess segments created on them.  Once this
operation is complete, it is possible to delete the logical volumes
that have been vacated.  This command can be issued from ring 4 only.


Arguments:
lv_i
   specifies the names of the logical volumes to be vacated.


Control arguments:
-long, -lg
   prints a message on the bootload console for each process directory
   which is processed as well as one for each segment within that
   directory which is processed.  If this control argument is not
   specified, the messages appear in the answering service log only.


Notes:  This command continues to process logical volumes only as long
as at least one logical volume remains in the PDIR volume set.

For every process directory whose segments are moved,
vacate_pdir_volume writes a message in the answering service log giving
the pathname of the process directory, the User_id of the user to whom
the perprocess segments belong, and the name of the logical volume from
which the process directory is being moved.  See also the
add_pdir_volume, del_pdir_volume, and set_pdir_volumes commands.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
