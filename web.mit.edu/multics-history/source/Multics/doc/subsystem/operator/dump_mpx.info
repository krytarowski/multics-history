02/13/85 dump_mpx

Syntax as a command:  dump_mpx mpx_name


Function:  forces an immediate dump of the specified multiplexer.  This
causes the multiplexer to crash, hanging up any users logged in over
its channels.  Therefore, if there are any such users, the number of
users is printed, and you are asked if the dump should still be taken.
Any reply other than "yes" causes the dump not to be taken, and the
multiplexer to continue running.  All the channels in the CDT that
match the starname a.* are hung up by this command.  This command can
be used in ring 4 only.


Arguments:
mpx_name
   specifies the name of the multiplexer to be dumped.


Notes:  Individual multiplexers respond to this command in whatever way
is appropriate to their implementation.  For FNPs a message is printed,
giving the pathname of the segment containing the dump of the FNP.
This is not a printable segment; its contents can be examined and
interpreted by a system programmer, using the online_dump_fnp (od_fnp)
or debug_fnp command.

This command should only be used at the direction of the system
programming staff.  The answering service automatically reloads a
multiplexer if it crashes.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
