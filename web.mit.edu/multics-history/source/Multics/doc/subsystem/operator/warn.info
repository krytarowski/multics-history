02/21/85  warn, w

Syntax as a command:  w User_id message


Function:  is used to output a message onto a user's terminal,
interrupting whatever other output is being printed.  This command can
be used in ring 4 only.


Arguments:
User_id
   specifies the user to whom the message should be sent.  It may be
   given in either of these forms:

         Person_id.Project_id
         Person_id Project_id

   The star convention is allowed.
message
   is a string that contains the text of the message to be sent to the
   user.


Notes:  If a user to be warned has specified the -no_warning (-nw)
argument at login, no warning message is sent to him, and you are told
that the user could not be warned.

The warn command should not be used for casual communication since the
message is forced into the middle of anything the user is typing,
ruining output.  Use the command only when the system is coming down
shortly, or is likely to crash, or when you have an urgent message for
a particular user who cannot be reached by telephone.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
