01/24/82  Standard subsystem request:  if

Syntax:  if EXPR -then LINE1 {-else LINE2}


Syntax as an active request:  if EXPR -then STR1 {-else STR2}


Function:  conditionally executes one of two request lines depending on
the value of an active string.  As an active request, returns one of
two character strings to the subsystem request processor depending on
the value of an active string.


Arguments:
EXPR
   is the active string which must evaluate to either "true" or
   "false".  The active string is constructed from subsystem active
   requests and Multics active strings (using the subsystem's execute
   active request).
LINE1
   is the subsystem request line to execute if EXPR evaluates to
   "true".  If the request line contains any request processor
   characters, it must be enclosed in quotes.
STR1
   is returned as the value of the if active request if the EXPR
   evaluates to "true".


LINE2
   is the subsystem request line to execute if EXPR evaluates to
   "false".  If omitted and EXPR is "false", no additional request line
   is executed.  If the request line contains any request processor
   characters, it must be enclosed in quotes.
STR2
   is returned as the value of the if active request if the EXPR
   evaluates to "false".  If omitted and the EXPR is "false", a null
   string is returned.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
