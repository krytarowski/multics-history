03/10/76 move_text, mt

Function:  relocates and resequences one or more lines of temporary text.
See Notes.


Syntax:  mt first_line {last_line} ,line_number


Arguments:
first_line   line number of first line to be moved.

last_line   line number of last line to be moved; if omitted, only
line specified by first_line is moved.

,line_number   line number after which moved lines are inserted.
This line number must be preceded by a comma.


Notes:
If new line numbers cause duplication of existing line numbers, enough
lines are resequenced to ensure no overlap.

Special editing is done for BASIC source text, i.e., references
to lines that are renumbered are edited to reflect the new numbers.

The first_line and last_line do not have to appear in the text, but 
the range specified by them must contain at least one line.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
