:Info:  use_ep_basic:  11/08/83 use_ep_basic

Syntax:  use_ep_basic

Function: Set the precision of BASIC programs run under the FAST subsystem to
be extended precision.  This may be used to reset the precision from the
single precision mode.


Notes: Single and extended precision programs should not be run at the same
time because the numeric arguments and numeric files are not compatible.  The
convert_numeric_file command is available for converting numeric files from
single to extended and vice versa.

The precision state is saved when the FAST subsystem is entered, and is
reset to the saved state when exited. Thus, use of the use_sp_basic and
use_ep_basic commands will not affect the BASIC environment outside of the
FAST subsystem.


A new statement type has been added to provide a means of dynamically
controlling the number of digits in a numeric value to be printed as output.
Its syntax is: 
   setdigits formula

The value expressed by formula is truncated to its integer value, and
represents the number of digits to be printed by all future PRINT statements
until another SETDIGITS statement is executed, or until the end of program
execution.  The value can be 1 through 19.  This statement applies only to
nonintegers.  The tab spacing is adjusted to accomodate the current number
length.  However, the spacing will never be less than the default.


:Info: use_sp_basic:  11/08/83 use_sp_basic

Syntax:  use_sp_basic

Function: Set the precision of BASIC programs run under the FAST subsystem to
be single precision. This is the default precision, and may be used to reset
the precision from the extended mode.


Notes: To get extended precision, invoke the use_ep_basic command with no
arguments.  Extended precision stays on until the use_sp_basic command is
issued.

Single and extended precision programs should not be run at the same time
because the numeric arguments and numeric files are not compatible.  The
convert_numeric_file command is available for converting numeric files from
single to extended and vice versa.

The precision state is saved when the FAST subsystem is entered, and is

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
