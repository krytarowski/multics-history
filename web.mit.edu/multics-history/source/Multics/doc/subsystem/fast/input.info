03/09/76 input

Function:  provides a convenient way to enter numbered lines. See Notes.


Syntax:  input {new_number} {increment}


Arguments:
new_number   number of the first new line; if omitted, lines are
entered at the end of the temporary text.

increment   increment of subsequent line numbers (default is 10).


Notes:
When this command is invoked, the system types the line number and one
space.  The user completes the line.  This input mode is terminated when
the user types a newline character without having typed any other
character on the line.


If the number given with the input command or a number generated by
the input request already exists or would cause the temporary text
to be out of sequence, an error message is printed and the user
is returned to command level.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
