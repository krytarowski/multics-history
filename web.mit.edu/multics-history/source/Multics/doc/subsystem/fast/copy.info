03/05/76 copy, cp

Function:  copies segments into the working directory.


Syntax:  cp path1A path2A ... path1N {path2N} {-control_arg}


Arguments:
path1i  is the pathname of a segment; star convention can be used.

path2i   is the pathname of copy created from path1i; if omitted,
copy is given the entryname of path1N.


Control arguments:  -name (-nm) copies multiple names.


Notes:Special action is taken if the name of the segment being copied
already exists in the working directory.  If the entry being
copied has an alternate name, the entryname that would have
resulted in a duplicate name is removed and the user is informed
of this action; the copying operation then takes place.  If the entry
being copied has only one entryname, the entry that already exists
in the directory must be deleted to remove the name.  The user is
asked if the deletion should be done; if the user answers "no", the
copying operation does not take place.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
