09/10/85  column_value, clv

Syntax as an active request:  [clv column_id {-control_args}]


Function:  This request returns the value of the specified column for
the current row, previous row, or next row.  It can only be used as an
active request.  It is used within a formatted report produced by the
display request to obtain the value of a column.  It is an error to use
this request anywhere except in a header/footer or editing string
within a report produced by the display request.


Arguments:
column_id
   specifies which column value is to be returned.  It can be given as
   the name of the column or the number of the column as selected
   through the subsystem.


Control arguments:
-current_row, -crw
   returns the value of the named column for the current row.
   (Default)
-default STR
   returns the character string STR when there is no previous row, or
   when there is no next row.  (Default value for STR is "" if this
   control argument is not provided.)
-next_row, -nrw
   returns the value of the named column for the next row.  If there is
   no next row, the string "" is returned unless changed by the
   -default control argument.
-previous_row, -prw
   returns the value of the named column for the previous row.  If
   there is no previous row, the string "" is returned unless changed
   by the -default control argument.


Notes:  When a subtotal is being generated, the column_value request
returns the value of the subtotal, rather than the value of the column.
An editing string for a column like "[pic $99v.99 [clv salary]]", would
edit the value of the salary column through the picture active request
for every row.  When a subtotal is being generated, the value of the
salary subtotal is edited through the picture active request.  This
behavior also applies to subcounts, counts, and totals, in addition to
subtotals.


Examples:
   [clv foo]
   [clv 3]
   [clv foo -previous_row]
   [clv foo -next_row -default NULL]

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
