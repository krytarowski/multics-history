09/10/85  save_format_options, svfo

Syntax:  svfo path {-format_option_args} {-control_args}


Function:  saves the current values of format options as a subsystem
exec_com.  The saved format can be restored with the
restore_format_options request.  The file is saved by utilizing a
suffix of fo.ec_name where ec_name is substituted by the subsystem's ec
suffix by the report writer.  Individual format options, active format
options, or all of the format options can be saved.  The requests used
to select the set of columns through the subsystem can also be saved.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the segment that contains the saved format.  If
   path does not have an fo.ec_name suffix, one is assumed.


format_options_args
   refer to the set_format_options request for a complete description
   of the format option arguments.  Each format option named has its
   value saved in the exec_com specified by path.  These arguments are
   incompatible with the -all and -active control arguments.

   SPECIFIC COLUMN OPTIONS
      -alignment, -al
      -editing, -ed
      -folding, -fold
      -separator, -sep
      -title, -ttl
      -width, -wid


Control arguments:
   can be one or more of the following:
-active, -act
   specifies that only the active formatting options are to be saved.
   (Default) "help formatting_options.gi" is typed for more information
   on active formatting options.  This control argument is incompatible
   with the format option arguments and the -all control argument.  If
   -active and -all are given, the last one supplied is used.
   (Default)


-all, -a
   specifies that all formatting options are to be saved.  This control
   argument is incompatible with the format option arguments and the
   -active control argument.  If -all and -active are given, the last
   one supplied is used.
-query
   specifies that the subsystem query request used to select the
   columns is to be saved.  A restore_format_options on the saved
   format also restores and makes the saved query current.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
