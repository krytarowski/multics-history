  Multics Design Documents are  the official design descriptions of
  the Multics Trusted Computing Base.  They are internal documents,
  which may be released outside  of Multics System Development only
  with the approval of the Director.

       The Multics Design Documents are  a series of documents that
  make up  the design documentation  required by the  "Criteria for
  the  Evaluation  of  Trusted  Computer  Systems".   Most  of  the
  documents in the series describe  the design of subsystems of the
  TCB.  There are a few exceptions,  such as this document, and the
  MDD that provides an overview of the design of the entire TCB.


  _1_._2 _C_R_E_A_T_I_O_N _O_F _M_D_D_'_S

       New MDD's are  written when new subsystems are  added to the
  Multics TCB, or when a need arises to add other special documents
  to the set.   MDD's are assigned numbers by  the Multics Security
  Coordinator.


  _1_._3 _C_O_N_T_E_N_T _O_F _M_D_D_'_S

       MAB-071, "Multics Programming Standards", provides standards
  for  the  content  and  format  of  MDD's.   In brief, MDD's that
  describe subsystems are required to describe:

  ox    The role of the subsystem in the system.

  ox    The security policies defined and enforced by the subsystem.

  ox    The functional implementation of  the subsystem to the level
       of detail of the interactions between modules.

  MDD's are not required  to include field-by-field descriptions of
  data structures or subroutine  descriptions of entrypoints.  This
  information  is contained  in  the  relevant sources  and include
  files.

       MDD's  are updated  when developers  make system  changes so
  that  they  always  accurately   describe  the  official  system.
  MAB-066,   "Configuration   Management:    Software   Development
  Procedures",  governs  MDD  update  and  insures  that  MDD's are
  updated to correspond to installed code.

       Only  one version  of each   MDD will  be maintained  in the
  library.  Old revisions will be discarded.

       New and changed MDD's are  checked by the Documentation Unit
  for  grammatical and spelling  errors, audited by  a peer of  the
  author, and approved by the Security Coordinator.


  _1_._6 _O_B_S_O_L_E_S_E_N_C_E _O_F _M_D_D_'_S

       When  a subsystem is  removed from the  Multics TCB, one  or
  more  MDD's   may  become  completely  obsolete.    The  Security
  Coordinator will update this document to indicate obsolete MDD's.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
