                              SECTION 1


               OVERVIEW OF THE RESOURCE CONTROL PACKAGE




       The Resource Control Package (RCP) controls the usage of and
  the access to I/O devices  (tape drives, printers, punches, etc.)
  and physical volumes  that can be mounted on  these devices (tape
  volumes, forms,  disk packs, etc.).  RCP  manages these resources
  through programs  located in ring-1  and which run  in the user's
  process.

       Resource Management  (RM) is an  option of RCP  which allows
  enforcement of  mandatory access controls (AIM)  for all resource
  types, volumes as well as devices.

       The Resource  Control Package works in  tandem with Resource
  Management when the later is enabled.  Indeed, they should not be
  thought of as two separate entities.   It is possible to have RCP
  without  RM enabled, but  it is not  possible to have  RM without
  RCP.   Resource Management  is simply  a feature  of the Resource
  Control Package that can be enabled at a site's discretion.

       RCP  software   reserves,  assigns  and   mounts  resources;
  demounts, unassigns,  and cancels resource reservations.   The RM
  option  of RCP  manages registration  and acquisition  as well as
  deregistration and release of  resources.  The hierarchical level
  of these functions are:

       The following two subsections outline, and briefly describe,
  the functions provided by RCP with and without RM enabled.


  _1_._1_._1 _F_u_n_c_t_i_o_n_s _o_f _R_C_P _W_i_t_h_o_u_t _R_M _E_n_a_b_l_e_d

       This package  allows users the ability to  assign devices to
  their process.   The result of  a device assignment  grants users
  exclusive rights  to that device  until the process  teminates or
  the  device is  explicilty  unassigned.   In addition,  users can
  reserve a  set of one  or more resources  for use at  some future
  time.  When an assignment is  requested, RCP will select a device
  from  the set already  reserved by the  user.  If no  devices are
  reserved, RCP will assign a  device that is appropriate according
  to criteria  specified by the  user, accessible to  the user, and
  available  (where available  means not  deleted and  not in use).
  The   most   common   use   of   resource   reservations   is  by
  absentee_utility_.   An  absentee  job   requiring  some  set  of
  resources  will not  be started  until absentee_utility_ reserves
  those  resources  thereby  guaranteeing  success  of any resource
  assignments   or   attachments   by   the   absentee  job.   Like
  assignments, reservations grant exclusive  rights to the resource
  until  the process  terminates or  the reservation  is explicitly
  cancelled.

       In order to actually use a device, a process must own an IOI
  attachment  to  it.   To  allow  RCP  to  enforce  the assignment
  discipline,  users are  prohibited from  calling ioi_$attach  and


                                 1-2
  Resource Control Package                                  MDD-009


  ioi_$detach directly.  Instead, RCP provides a mechanism for both
  attaching and detaching to a  previously assigned device.  In the
  event that  a process attempts to  attach to a device  it has not
  yet assigned, RCP will  automatically accomplish this step.  When
  the process has  completed its use of the device,  it can detach,
  unassign and cancel its reservation.

       There are  three main databases  of RCP.  The  Resource Type
  Description  Table  (RTDT),  located  in  >sc1>rtdt, contains one
  entry (RTDE) for each resource type known to the system.  Another
  database,  found  in  >sl1>rcp_data,  contains  information about
  specific  devices  managed   by  RCP.   Lastly,  >sl1>rcp_com_seg
  contains   information   about   current   device   reservations,
  assignments  and attachments.   The  RTDT  is an  installed table
  while rcp_data and rcp_com_seg are not retained across bootloads.

       When RM  is enabled by  a site, resources  are introduced to
  the  system through  the registration  process.  A  registry is a
  database,  one  for  each  type  of  resource  in the RTDT, which
  consists  of a set  of records where  each record identifies  one
  particular  resource  of  that  type.   Each  entry  in the RTDT,
  (RTDE),  in turn  describes  the  associated registry  located in
  >sc1>rcp>RESOURCE_TYPE.rcpr   (see  rcp_resource_types.incl.pl1).
  To make a resource of a  particular type available to the system,
  the  resource is registered  and the information  is kept in  the
  registry for  that resource type.   A resource can  be registered
  with information  such as its  name, owner, and  potential access
  class range for AIM restrictions.  Registering a resource has the
  effect of making the resource part  of the free pool of resources
  available to the system.  A  resource registered in the free pool
  is  available for  acquisition by  everyone.  Resources  that are
  registered  remain  so  until  they  are  explicitly deregistered
  making them unavailable to the system.

       Once  a resource  has been  registered, it  can be acquired.
  Resources are acquired from the free pool for use by a particular
  user.  The owner of the resource then becomes that user until the
  resource is  released.  When a resource is  released, the "manual
  clear"  flag is  checked.  If  it  is  on, the  resource must  be
  cleared,  with  the  clear_resource  command,  by  a  user with E
  (execute)  access to  the rcp_sys_  gate.  Once  the resource  is
  cleared,  or if  the "manual   clear" flag  is off,  the resource
  returns to  the free pool.  Often,  a site will acquire  a set of
  resources  to the  system pool,  thus making  the owner "system".
  For  example, it  is recommended   that tape  and disk  drives be
  acquired to the system pool for the common benefit of all to use.

       Enabling RM provides a site  with an additional option, that
  of auto registration.  It is possible  for a site to turn on auto
  registration so that  when a process requests a  resource, and it
  has not been registered, it will be automatically registered.  It
  seems  unlikely, however,  that a  site running  with RM  enabled
  would  want  to  do  this,  since  such  a  site is probably more
  conscious  of  security  issues  and  would  want  to enforce the
  additional security features provided  by the manual registration
  process of Resource Management.

                              SECTION 2


           SECURITY ISSUES IN THE RESOURCE CONTROL PACKAGE




       The following subsections discuss the security policy of the
  Resource  Control Package  with and  without Resource  Management
  Enabled.

       Although the  access modes for  RCP objects are  the same as
  for segments,  that being REW, they are  actually extended access
  modes with  a different meaning than the  standard segment access
  modes.


          read (R)      - a process with R access to a resource
                          can read the contents of the resource.

          write (W)     - a process with W access to a resource can
                          write the contents of the resource.

          executive (E) - a process with E access to a resource can
                          change the attributes of the resource, in
                          effect giving the  same rights to  the
                          process as the resource owner would have.



       The  three  types  of  access,  discretionary access (Access
  Control   Lists),  intraprocess   access  (ring   brackets),  and
  mandatory access (AIM), are used  in combination to determine the
  real, or effective,  access mode of the process  to the resource.
  The  effective  mode  is  determined  by  first  calculating  the
  discretionary access  or raw mode,  and performing a  logical AND
  with the ring  bracket mode.  Then performing a  logical AND with
  the  AIM mode.   Each type   of access  is determined  separately
  according to the access rules described in the following sections
  and is dependent upon Resource Management enabled or disabled.

       The  raw mode is  determined by looking  at the ACS  segment
  found    in   >sc1>rcp>RESOURCE_NAME.acs    (i.e.    tape_01.acs,
  dska_03.acs).   There will  be an  ACS segment  for every  device
  known to RCP.   Volumes do not have an ACS  segment when Resource
  Management is disabled.   The default raw mode for  volumes is RW
  for *.*.*.


  _2_._2_._2 _R_e_s_o_u_r_c_e _M_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t _E_n_a_b_l_e_d

       The appropriate  registry for the type of  resource is found
  via  the RTDT.   It is  called >sc1>rcp>RESOURCE_TYPE.rcpr.  Once
  the registry is  found, it is searched for  the particular device
  or  volume record.   The record  specifies the  ACS pathname from
  which the  raw mode is determined.   There will always be  an ACS
  segment  for devices,  regardless of  whether RM  is disabled  or
  enabled.  If no  ACS exists for a volume,  the following defaults
  are used:


         owner = Person_id.Project_id  REW  owner
                                       NULL everyone
         owner = free                  NULL everyone
         owner = system                NULL everyone

       Ring  brackets are  found by  looking at  the ring  brackets
  associated with the ACS segment  for the resource.  The rules for
  locating the ACS segment are dependent on whether or not Resource
  Management is enabled and is the same as for Discretionary Access
  (see above).  In the event that there is no ACS segment, the ring
  bracket check is bypassed.

       In the event that ring  brackets do exist, the resource will
  have  ring  brackets  in  the  form  of  r1,r2,r3 as segments do.
  However, the implementation is different than the normal handling
  of  ring brackets.   0-r1 defines  the REW (read/executive/write)
  bracket while 0-r2 defines the R (read) bracket.

       Since  AIM  restrictions  are   not  imposed  when  Resource
  Management is  disabled, this discussion only applies  to when RM
  is enabled.  Each  resource has a range associated  with it known


                                 2-2
  Resource Control Package                                  MDD-009


  as  the  access  class  range  of  the  resource  and  is used to
  determine  how a  process can  access a  resource subject  to AIM
  restrictions.     The     range    is    in    the     form    of
  min_access_class:max_access_class where min  <= max.  Each access
  class has the  form of level and category set  where the category
  set can be null.

       A user must  have E access to rcp_admin_ gate  to register a
  resource.   When  a  resource  is  registered  it  is  assigned a
  potential access class range.  The default potential access class
  range is taken from the RTDT  access class range for that type of
  resource.  If  the potential access  class range is  specified in
  the registration process, the following rules apply:

  ox    The potential access class range  specified must be a subset
       of the access class range specified in the RTDT.

  ox    The  min_access_class of  the potential  access class  range
       specified   cannot   be   less   than   the  user's  current
       authorization unless the rcp privilege is turned on.


       When a resource is acquired, it is assigned an actual access
  class   range.     The   default   is    minimum_access_class   =
  maximum_access_class = process' current authorization, which is a
  single-class resource.   A user with E access  to rcp_admin_ gate
  can specify an access class  range at acquisition time subject to
  the rules specified below.

  ox    The  access class range  specified must be  a subset of  the
       potential access class range.

  ox    The  min_access_class of  the specified  access class  range
       cannot be less than  the user's current authorization unless
       the rcp privilege is turned on.


       It  should be  noted that  a volume  with a min_access_class
  less  than the  max_access_class is  a multi-class  volume.  Only
  processes running  in ring-1 or processes with  the rcp privilege
  turned  on  will  be  allowed  to  assign  and attach mutli-class
  volumes.  However, there is  currently no supporting software for
  accessing multi-class  volumes.  A device, on the  other hand, is
  often acquired as  a multi-class resource but at  attach time the
  access       class      range       becomes      the       user's
  current_authorization:current_authorization     and    thus     a
  single-class resource.

       If  the resource  is free  (i.e.  owner  = "free"),  the AIM
  access is  determined from the  potential access class  range and
  the  user's current  authorization; otherwise  the AIM  access is
  determined  from the  access class  range and  the user's current
  authorization.  Access  is determined according to  the following
  rules and order:

  ox    If the min_access_class is greater than or disjoint from the
       user's current authorization, R access (and thus all access)
       is denied since we can't read up.

  ox    Since E  access allows writing of  protected attributes, the
       user's   current  authorization   must  be   equal  to   the
       min_access_class.  E  access is denied anywhere  else in the
       range to prevent a potential covert channel.

  ox    If the  max_access_class is less than or  disjoint, W access
       is denied since we can't write down.  R access is preserved,
       however,  E access  must also  be denied  since that  allows
       writing of protected attributes and we have just been denied
       W access.

       There are  four main gates through which  RCP operations are
  performed.   The  ring  brackets  on  all  four  gates are 1,1,5.
  Normal user  commands such as  acquire_resource, assign_resource,
  attach_,  detach_, list_resource, etc.,  use the rcp_  gate.  The
  ACL on this  gate gives RE access to *.*.*.   The rcp_admin_ gate
  gives RE access to RCP administrators and system processes and is
  generally   used   for    operations   such   as   copy_registry,
  delete_registry,  register_resource_, deregister_resource_,  etc.
  Access to the rcp_priv_ gate  is given only to special privileged
  processes.   It is  primarily used   for T&D  operations such  as
  copy_meters,  and to  perform privileged  attaches.  The rcp_sys_
  gate  gives access  only to  system daemon  processes and special
  system  processes.  Operations  called through  rcp_sys_ are used
  primarily   during   system   initialization   and   creation  or
  re-creation  of the  RCP registries.   Operator commands  such as
  clear_resource and authenticate_device, as well as add and delete
  device are also called through rcp_sys_.

       There are  two kinds of privilege.  The  first is privileged
  gate access.  For RCP purposes, a user with E access to rcp_sys_,
  or  rcp_admin_  has  privileged  gate  access.   The  use of some
  commands require  privileged gate access.  Examples  of these are
  copy_registry,    delete_registry,     deregister_resource    and
  register_resource which all require  E access to rcp_admin_ gate;
  reconstruct_registry and  remove_registry which require  E access

  to  rcp_sys_  gate.   Other  commands,  such  as acquire_resource
  require  the use  of the   -priv argument  to use  the privileged
  acquire_resource as opposed to the regular acquire_resource.  The
  Commands  and  Active  Functions  Manaul  (AG92)  specifies these
  control arguments.  Performing an  operation through a privileged
  gate (rcp_sys_  or rcp_admin_), has the effect  of by-passing the
  access checks  for discretionary access (ACL  and ring brackets),
  but not AIM checks.

       The second  type of privilege  is the rcp  system privilege.
  The user must have the ability  to set system privileges in order
  to turn on  the rcp privilege.  Turning on the  rcp privilege has
  the  effect  of  by-passing  the  AIM  access  checks but not the
  discretionary access checks.

       Special  privilege  is  granted  to Initializer.SysDaemon.z,
  by-passing all access checks  and automatically given REW access.
  This occurs  mainly during system  boot when RCP  is initialized.
  In addition, the effective mode is  REW for a register or acquire
  operation.  The only access checks made for a register or acquire
  operation are those listed  above under "Setting Potential Access
  Class Range and Access Class Range".

       For  RCP  purposes,  access  to  the  rcp_priv_  gate is not
  considered privileged gate access in that performing an operation
  through rcp_priv_ does not by-pass discretionary access checks.

       Some  operations  require  different  effective  access  for
  volumes  and  devices.   Other   operations  are  independent  of
  resource type.   The following list  identifies the types  of RCP
  operations,  the required effective  access and any  other access
  requirements needed to perform the operation.

  ox    Register a resource
       requires E access to rcp_admin_ gate.

  ox    Deregister a resource
       requires E access to rcp_admin_ gate.

  ox    Acquire a resource
       requires E  access to rcp_admin_ gate to  acquire a resource
       for someone else.  Everyone has  access to acquire all other
       resources for themselves.  The resource must have an owner =
       "free" to be acquired.

  ox    Release a resource acquisition
       requires  the  user  be  the  resource  owner  and  have REW
       effective access to  the resource.  A user with  E access to

       rcp_admin_ gate can force the release of a resource acquired
       to another user.

  ox    Reserve a volume
       requires R effective access.

  ox    Reserve a device
       requires RW effective access.

  ox    Cancel a resource reservation
       requires  the  user  to  be  the  one  who  made  the volume
       reservation.   A user  with E  access to  rcp_sys_ gate  can
       cancel a reservation made by another user.  Does not require
       any access to the resource.

  ox    Assign a volume for reading
       requires R effective access.

  ox    Assign a volume for writing
       requires RW effective access.

  ox    Assign a device
       devices  are  always  assigned  for  writing  and require RW
       effective access.

  ox    Unassign a resource
       requires  the  user  to  be  the  one  who made the resource
       assignment.   A user  with E  access to  rcp_admin_ gate can
       force an  unassignment.  In addition, a  process termination
       forces the unassignment of all acquisitions for the process.

  ox    Attach a resource
       same as for assignment.

  ox    Detach a resource
       same as for unassign.

  ox    Preload a volume
       requires R effective access.

  ox    Preload a device
       requires RW effective access.

  ox    Add or delete a device
       requires E access to rcp_sys_, and R access to the deivce.

  ox    Set access_class_range or potential_access_class_range
       requires  E  access  to  rcp_admin_  gate  and REW effective
       access to the resource.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is provided and donated
to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. 
as a contribution to computer science knowledge.  
This donation is made also to give evidence of the common contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Bell Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc., Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL
and BULL HN Information Systems Inc. to the development of this operating system. 
Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC (1963-1970),
renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership
of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided the best software architecture 
for managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems 
incorporated Multics principles.
Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., 
as successor in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
